1,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In the first paragraph the reader is introduced to Nawab, a father of twelve daughters who feels compelled to make more money to care for his family: “he must proliferate his sources of revenue” (lines 6-7). The remainder of the paragraph focuses on the way Nawab attempts to “proliferate” those income sources by identifying some of the moneymaking schemes Nawab undertakes, including setting up a flour mill and a fish farm and attempting to fix both radios and watches. Choice A is incorrect because even if the first paragraph does indicate that Nawab is willing to work hard to take care of his family, it does not specifically address how he interacts with his daughters emotionally. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph describes some of Nawab’s activities but not the specifics of his schedule. Choice D is incorrect because the first paragraph introduces Harouni as Nawab’s employer but does not describe his lifestyle.",false,reading,mcq,
2,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The passage states that Nawab earned “more kicks than kudos” (line 16) for his failed attempts at fixing watches. In the context of not doing a job well, this means Nawab was not given compliments (“kudos”) for his efforts but complaints (“kicks”) about them. Choices A and D are incorrect because the passage clearly states that Nawab was not successful fixing watches, which earned him a negative response (“kicks,” or complaints). In this context it would be illogical to suggest that Nawab’s unsuccessful efforts at fixing watches would result in the sort of positive response implied by choice A (“thrills”) or choice D (“interests”). Choice C is incorrect because even though “jolts” might be unpleasant, they’re not the kind of negative response one would get instead of compliments.",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
3,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The passage states that Nawab works “like an engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer in an Atlantic gale” (lines 26-28) in his attempts to keep his employer comfortable. The author likely uses this image because it highlights the challenging nature of Nawab’s work—work that is described in the next sentence as requiring “superhuman efforts” (line 28). Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the author’s use of the image of an engineer working hard on a “foundering steamer” describes the effort Nawab is making in keeping his employer comfortable, not what Nawab might be dreaming about, anything to do with tube wells (which are not mentioned in the second paragraph), or that Nawab has had many different jobs in his life.",false,reading,mcq,
4,A,"Choice A is the best answer because lines 28-32 show that Nawab is an efficient employee, stating that due to his “superhuman efforts,” Nawab is able to keep his employer comfortable, or in almost “the same mechanical cocoon . . . that the landowner enjoyed in Lahore.” Choice B is incorrect because lines 40-42 describe the actions of Nawab’s employer only and do not address the employer’s feelings about Nawab’s work. Choice C is incorrect because lines 46-49 show Nawab characterizing himself as an old and ineffective employee, not one who performs his job well. Choice D is incorrect because line 58 addresses the fact Nawab had always lived in his employer’s household but not his effectiveness as an employee.",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
5,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The main purpose of Nawab’s comments in lines 43-52 is to highlight the labor and service he has provided for Harouni over the years. Nawab says “there is but one man, me, your servant” to take care of the tube wells on all Harouni’s vast lands and that the extensive work has resulted in Nawab earning gray hairs on his employer’s behalf. Choice A is incorrect because even though lines 43-52 initially highlight the vastness of Harouni’s lands, those lines primarily focus on Nawab’s dedication and service to Harouni. Choice B is incorrect because lines 43-52 emphasize not that Nawab is competent and reliable but that Nawab feels he is no longer able to adequately fulfill his duties. Choice D is incorrect because in lines 43-52, Nawab doesn’t say he intends to quit his job, asking instead only for help doing it.",false,reading,mcq,
6,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 61-62, Nawab says to his employer that he “cannot any longer bicycle about like a bridegroom from farm to farm.” In this context, Nawab uses the word “bridegroom” to imply he is no longer a young man who can easily travel such great distances on his bike. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in the context of Nawab not being able to bike so far, he uses the word “bridegroom” to imply that he is no longer young, not that he is no longer in love (choice A), naive (choice B), or busy (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
7,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Harouni’s reaction to Nawab’s request for a new motorcycle can be found in lines 66-68, where the employer is said not to “particularly care one way or the other, except that it touched on his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.” For Harouni, in other words, the issue of Nawab getting a new motorcycle came down to what was best for Harouni, not what was best for Nawab. Choice A is incorrect because in the passage Harouni is said not to be particularly impressed with how hard Nawab works; he cares about the issue of the motorcycle only in regard to its effect on his own comfort. Choice C is incorrect because Harouni is said to find Nawab’s speech not eloquent but “florid” (line 54), meaning flamboyant or ostentatious. Choice D is incorrect because Nawab does not threaten to quit his job but politely asks his employer to “let me go” (line 64).",false,reading,mcq,
8,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks why Harouni purchases his employee Nawab a new motorcycle, with the correct answer (that Harouni did so because it was in his own best interest) supported in lines 66-68: “He didn’t particularly care one way or the other, except that it touched on his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about why Harouni buys Nawab a new motorcycle. Instead, they simply identify the issue (choice A), note that Harouni also gave Nawab money for gas (choice C), and show how the motorcycle affects Nawab’s side businesses (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
9,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The passage states that Nawab’s new motorcycle leads to the “disgust of the farm managers” (line 74). Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the passage specifically says Nawab’s new motorcycle leads to the “disgust of the farm managers,” not their happiness (choice B), envy (choice C), or indifference (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
10,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The passage specifically states what Nawab considers the greatest part of his getting a new motorcycle: “Best of all, now he could spend every night with his wife” (lines 81-82). Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the passage explicitly states that Nawab believes the best thing about his new motorcycle is that he can “spend every night with his wife,” not that people start calling him “Uncle” (choice A), that he is able to expand his business (choice B), or that he is able to educate his daughters (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
11,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The passage states that historically, “newspapers such as The Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative agendas and conventional wisdom” (lines 27-30). But it goes on to say that “there is a growing feeling . . . that the news media should be ‘informative rather than authoritative’” (lines 70-73). Together these lines indicate the main purpose of the passage, which is to discuss how people’s perception of the news media is changing from its being an authoritative voice to simply an informative one. Choice A is incorrect because the passage deals with changes in the way news is perceived but does not primarily focus on the technological changes that may have resulted in those or other changes. Choice C is incorrect because even if the passage implies that viewers might increasingly believe a journalist’s values can affect the news stories being produced, it does not provide specific examples of that happening. Choice D is incorrect because the passage begins with the simple sentence “The news is a form of public knowledge” (line 1) and makes no attempt to refute that claim.",false,reading,mcq,
12,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Although the passage initially states that traditional news authorities were once implicitly “trusted” (line 29) regarding the content they produced, it goes on to note that “as part of the general process of the transformation of authority . . . the demand has been for all authority to make explicit the frames of value which determine their decisions” (lines 33-38). The modern audience, in other words, wants to hear not only the stories a news organization produces but also the values that form the foundation of that organization’s beliefs. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because lines 33-38 make clear that the expectation traditional authorities now face is the need to “make explicit the frames of value which determine their decisions,” not that they shouldn’t be affected by commercial interests (choice A), that they should work for the common good (choice B), or that they should consider the context of public versus private knowledge (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
13,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The previous question asks what expectation traditional authorities now face, with the answer being that they must make their perspectives or beliefs clear to the audience. This is supported in lines 33-38: “As part of the general process of the transformation of authority . . . the demand has been for all authority to make explicit the frames of value which determine their decisions.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about what expectation traditional authorities now face, instead contrasting private and public knowledge (choice A), explaining the complexity of news dissemination (choice B), and providing one way news has changed in modern times (choice D)",false,reading,mcq,
14,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 23-25, the passage states that “there is not always common agreement about what the public needs to know.” In this context, a “common” agreement is a widespread one shared by many people. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in the context of something shared by many people, the word “common” implies that it is widespread, not that it is plentiful or abundant (choice A), recognizable to others (choice B), or normal (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
15,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Two quotes are provided in lines 43-53, one highlighting the way editors work differently in modern times due to the demands of the audience and one offering an opinion about the perceived negative effects of that new reality of news. Those extended quotations were added by the authors most likely because they provide concrete examples of how some journalists feel about modern news dissemination. Choice A is incorrect because the two quotations provided in lines 43-53 are not contradictory: the first offers a description of how news editors work differently in modern times, and the second describes how certain changes might affect news stories or the audience. Choices C and D are incorrect because the two quotations illustrate how some feel about the way the dissemination of news might be changing and are not used to either criticize or make suggestions.",false,reading,mcq,
16,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The passage explains that although the major news organizations were once considered “trusted shapers” (line 29) of public knowledge, that perception is changing due to the “growing feeling . . . that the news media should be ‘informative rather than authoritative’; the job of journalists should be to ‘give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it’; and people should be given ‘sufficient information’ from which ‘we would be able to form opinions of our own’” (lines 70-77). In other words, the audience now wants raw facts about the world, not facts constructed in support of a certain opinion. Choice B is incorrect because the passage presents the public as wanting information without any slant on it, not as wanting only a limited amount of information. Choices C and D are incorrect because the passage does not specifically identify the public’s feelings about including quotations from authorities in news stories or how they would want jou",false,reading,mcq,
17,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The previous question asks what the public is beginning to believe should be avoided in news stories, with the answer being the personal opinions or feelings of journalists. This is supported in lines 70-77: “There is a growing feeling . . . that the news media should be ‘informative rather than authoritative’; the job of journalists should be to ‘give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it’; and people should be given ‘sufficient information’ from which ‘we would be able to form opinions of our own.’” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer that the modern public wants journalists to avoid personal judgments when telling news stories, instead contrasting personal or private knowledge with public knowledge (choice A), characterizing how trusted broadcasters were once viewed (choice B), and explaining how some professional journalists feel about the new reality of the news (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
18,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 73-75, the passage states the modern belief that “the job of journalists should be to ‘give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it.’” In this context, the word “raw” means unfiltered or in its most basic state. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of news without any “slant on it,” the word “raw” implies something unfiltered, not something unprotected or uncovered (choice B), severe (choice C), or untried or unproven (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
19,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The table shows that in 1985, 55% of respondents believed news organizations “get the facts straight,” which was the highest percentage for that choice for any of the years provided. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the table shows that the percentage of respondents who believed news organizations “get the facts straight” was smaller in 1992 (49%), 2003 (36%), and 2011 (25%) than in 1985 (55%).",false,reading,mcq,
20,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The table shows that from 2003 to 2007, the percentage of people who believed news organizations “get the facts straight” rose only minimally, from 36 to 39%, while their perception of the independence and fairness of those organizations changed not at all, remaining at 23% and 26%, respectively. Choice A is incorrect because the table indicates viewers’ perceptions of the accuracy of news organizations but does not identify how many inaccurate news stories there were in any of the years listed. Choice B is incorrect because the number of people who believe news organizations “tend to favor one side” did not double between 1992 and 2003, rising only from 63% to 66%. Choice D is incorrect because the table shows that between 2007 and 2011, people’s perception of the accuracy of news organizations decreased rather than increased, dropping from 39% to 25%.",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
21,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The 2011 data in the table indicate that only 25% of respondents believed news organizations were accurate, 15% believed they were independent, and 16% believed they were fair. Combined, these data support the idea put forth in lines 69-70 that modern audiences are becoming skeptical of the authority of experts. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the 2011 data in the table show the public’s lack of faith in the accuracy, independence, and fairness of news organizations but do not indicate how politically involved that public was (choice A), demonstrate the claims of experts (choice B), or reveal the importance of viewer mouse clicks in modern news (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
22,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The first paragraph of the passage identifies and describes “Texas gourd vines” (line 1), but the primary focus of the passage is introduced in the first sentence of the second paragraph: “In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler took on the specific problem of the Texas gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles” (lines 17-20). The remainder of the passage focuses on describing the purpose, process, and results of the recent research done on those Texas gourd vines. Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn’t focus on the assumptions behind a theory but rather on the way in which that theory was tested. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not present much conflicting data; most of it supports the idea there can be too much fragrance for the Texas gourd vine. Choice D is incorrect because the passage explains the procedures used in a study were “’very labor intensive’” (line 58) but does not present them as particularly innovative.",false,reading,mcq,
23,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The passage says that to test their hypothesis, the scientists “planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field” (lines 33-34) and then ultimately walked “from flower to flower, observing each for two-minute intervals” (lines 62-63). Because they gathered data by looking at and studying the plants in question, the scientists’ research is best characterized as relying on direct observation. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because lines 62-63 make clear that the research emphasized direct observation, not historical data (choice B), expert testimony (choice C), or random sampling (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
24,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The passage states that by using the smell of their nectar to lure pollinators like bees, Texas gourd vines are employing an “’open communication network’” that attracts “’not just the good guys, but . . . also . . . the bad guys’” (lines 7-10). Because cucumber beetles are then identified as some of “the very bad guys” (line 12) as far as the Texas gourd plant is concerned, it can be inferred that both the beetles and the bees are attracted to the same scent. Choices A and C are incorrect because they are not supported by the text; the passage states that cucumber beetles “chew up pollen and petals” (lines 12-13) from the Texas gourd vines but not that those vines are their “primary” food source, and the passage does not address any effects, positive or negative, that cucumber beetles experience as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease. Choice B is incorrect because the passage states that treating the Texas gourd vines with dimethoxybenzene led to “double the normal number of beetles” (lines 65-66) but that pollinators like bees “did not prefer” (line 67) the treated flowers, which implies that cucumber beetles are not less attracted but more attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are.",false,reading,mcq,
25,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The author indicates that it is reasonable to think that the Texas gourd plants might lure more pollinators if their smell was stronger. This is clear from lines 26-27, which state that “intuition suggests that more of that aroma should be even more appealing to bees.” Choices A and D are incorrect because lines 26-27 support the idea that it was initially thought that Texas gourd vines could lure more pollinators through “more of that aroma,” not by lacking an aroma (choice A) or giving off a more varied aroma (choice D). Choice B is incorrect because bees are the only pollinators specifically discussed in the passage, and there is no suggestion that targeting other insects would attract more bees.",false,reading,mcq,
26,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The passage explains that as part of their research the scientists “made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one” (lines 35-39). In this context, a flower that was “treated” would be one that was changed or altered. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of a flower having a compound like dimethoxybenzene added to it, the word “treated” means changed or altered, not returned to normal (choice B), given (choice C), or kept for future use (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
27,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In the passage Theis surmises that honey bees were likely repelled not by the enhanced fragrance of the dimethoxybenzene-treated flowers but “by the abundance of beetles” (lines 71-72) found on them. She was able to make that assumption because the honey bees were able to choose between both normal flowers and fragrance-enhanced flowers without any beetles on them, because one of the parameters of the research was that “every half hour throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to the blossoms with and without interference by beetles” (lines 45-50). Choice A is incorrect because the passage states only that the scientists observed the bees and beetles on the flowers as soon as they opened (lines 59-61), not both before and after they opened. Choice B is incorrect because although the passage does state that the experiment only took place during the “August flowering season” (line 35), it doesn’t state that this was a variable in the experiment or had any effect on it. Choice C is incorrect because comparing gourds based on the type of pollination is not related to the issue of what repelled bees from the fragrance-enhanced plants.",false,reading,mcq,
28,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The previous question asks what Theis and Adler did to allow Theis to theorize that the bees were repelled not by the enhanced fragrance of certain flowers but by the excessive number of beetles on them, with the answer (they give the bees the chance to visit both normal and fragrance-enhanced flowers that did not have beetles on them) being supported in lines 45- 50: “So every half hour throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to the blossoms with and without interference by beetles.” Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about what allowed Theis and Adler to theorize that the bees were repelled not by fragrance but by insects, instead highlighting a variable that didn’t directly address the effect of fragrance on bees (choice B), describing the timing of one of the steps undertaken in the experiment (choice C), and discussing an aspect of gourd growth that was not related to the question of why bees may or may not have wanted to visit fragrance-enhanced flowers (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
29,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The first six paragraphs (lines 1-64) of the passage introduce a plant (the Texas gourd vine) and its problem (luring enough insects to pollinate it but not too many of those that will harm it) and then describe a study undertaken to deal with “the specific problem of the Texas gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles” (lines 18-20). After the specifics of that experiment are described in detail, the results are explained and summarized in the seventh and eighth paragraphs (lines 65-84): “What they saw was double the normal number of beetles. . . . Squash bees were indifferent, and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often. . . . That added up to less reproduction for fragrance-enhanced flowers” (lines 65-76). Choice B is incorrect because Theis and Adler’s hypothesis (that more fragrance would make the flowers “even more appealing to bees,” line 27) is found in the third paragraph (lines 26-40). Choice C is incorrect because Theis and Adler’s methods are described in the third through sixth paragraphs (lines 26-64), not the seventh and eighth (lines 65-84). Choice D is incorrect because the seventh and eighth paragraphs detail the results in an experiment but do not focus on the researchers’ reasoning.",false,reading,mcq,
30,B,"Choice B is the best answer. To be “indifferent” is to be apathetic, or without care or concern. In the context of an experiment that tested whether or not insects preferred normally scented flowers or ones with enhanced fragrance, describing the squash bees as “indifferent” implies they did not care about the scents and were equally drawn to both types of flowers. Choice A is incorrect because “indifference” suggests the amount of concern one has about something but not anything to do with physical capabilities (such as being able to distinguish between the flowers). Choice C is incorrect because “indifference” suggests that one has no preference. Choice D is incorrect because the squash bees are said to be “indifferent” to certain flowers based on their fragrance, not on the number of beetles that may or may not be on them.",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
31,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Theis and Adler’s research clearly provided an answer to the question of why there is an upper limit on the intensity of the aroma emitted by Texas gourd plants, as their experiment was described as being able to “provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent” (lines 85-86). Choice A is incorrect because Theis and Adler’s research was not able to show how to increase pollinator visits to the Texas gourd vine, as the results of their experiment showed that “pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the highly scented flowers” (lines 67-68). Choice C is incorrect because Theis and Adler’s research was not able to explain how hand pollination rescued fruit weight, a finding the passage describes as “a hard-to-interpret result” (line 83). Choice D is incorrect because the passage never indicates that the flowers stop producing fragrance when beetles are present.",false,reading,mcq,
32,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The previous question asks what question from among the answer choices Theis and Adler’s research was able to answer regarding Texas gourd vines. The answer (they determined why there was an upper limit to the amount of fragrance produced) is supported in lines 85- 86: “The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent.” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about what Theis and Adler’s research revealed about Texas gourd vines, instead explaining the goal of the experiment undertaken (choice A), identifying some of the fragrance compounds found in the plant’s aroma (choice B), and describing results related to hand pollination rather than fragrance (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
33,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 1, Lincoln asserts that citizens of the United States should never break the laws of their land, for any reason, because to do so undermines the nation’s values. This is clearly demonstrated when he says, “let every man remember that to violate the law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the character of his own, and his children’s liberty” (lines 9-12). Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln says that bad laws “should be repealed as soon as possible” (line 30), not that breaking the law would slow their repeals. Choice C is incorrect because Lincoln says that “there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law” (lines 36-37) but doesn’t argue that breaking the law will lead to mob rule. Choice D is incorrect because in his speech Lincoln doesn’t discuss divisions between social groups.",false,reading,mcq,
34,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The previous question asks what Lincoln believes is the result of breaking the laws, with the answer being that such actions undermine a nation’s values. This is supported in lines 9-12: “let every man remember that to violate the law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the character of his own, and his children’s liberty.” Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question regarding what Lincoln contends happens when citizens break the law, instead explaining exactly which groups Lincoln believes should vow to follow the laws (choice B), illustrating how Lincoln believes unjust laws should be dealt with (choice C), and stating Lincoln’s belief that no law is ever improved through mob rule (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
35,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 24-25, Lincoln says, “I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws.” In this context, the word “urge” most nearly means advocate, because when Lincoln urges people to obey the laws, he is pleading in favor of them doing so. Choices A and C are incorrect because in the context of lines 24-25 (“I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws”), to urge that laws be followed is to advocate for them to be obeyed, not to speed up such adherence (choice A) or make such adherence necessary (choice C). Choice B is incorrect because Lincoln is asking people to follow the laws but not directly causing people to obey them.",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
36,D,"Choice D is the best answer. After advocating for citizens “never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country” (lines 3-4), Lincoln begins the second paragraph by making another point: “When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise, for the redress of which, no legal provisions have been made” (lines 24-28). This sentence is an attempt on Lincoln’s part to make clear what could be a misunderstanding of his position (“let me not be understood”) and to correct that possible misunderstanding. Lincoln doesn’t want people to believe he is saying all laws are always good, but rather that those laws need to be followed as long as they are on the books. Choices A and B are incorrect because the sentence in lines 24-28 does not raise and refute a possible counterargument to Lincoln’s argument or identify a shortcoming of his argument, but rather it is an attempt on Lincoln’s part to make sure he is not misunderstood. Choice C is incorrect because that sentence does not acknowledge and provide support for a central assumption of Lincoln’s argument but looks at a different aspect of the issue.",false,reading,mcq,
37,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In the passage Lincoln states his belief that any laws that “continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed” (lines 31-32). In this context, “observed” most nearly means followed, as Lincoln is urging citizens to heed or follow the country’s laws. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of Lincoln advocating that laws be religiously “observed,” he means those laws should be followed, not that they should be studied closely (choice B), considered at length (choice C), or merely recognized (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
38,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Passage 2 begins with Thoreau’s statement that “unjust laws exist” (line 45). His philosophy regarding how to deal with those unjust laws is evident in lines 58-59: “If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go.” Thoreau believes, in other words, that some injustices are an unfortunate part of normal governance and just need to be endured (“let it go, let it go”). Choice A is incorrect because Thoreau does not say some unjust aspects of government can be fixed easily or that they are merely superficial. Choice B is incorrect because Thoreau does not argue that such injustices are subtle and should be studied, but rather that in certain cases it is best to “let it go, let it go” (line 59), while in other cases one should act or “break the law” (line 66). Choice C is incorrect because Thoreau does not say that any such unjust aspects of government are beneficial or helpful.",false,reading,mcq,
39,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The previous question asks what Thoreau feels about some unjust aspects of government, with the answer being that he finds them inevitable and something that needs to be endured. This is supported in lines 58-59: “If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about Thoreau’s thoughts regarding certain injustices in government, instead asking a theoretical question about how one should respond to unjust laws (choice A), providing an observation about how some view acting out against unjust laws (choice B), and acknowledging that in some questions of conscience, one may or may not choose to act (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
40,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In Passage 1, Lincoln makes clear his belief that individuals should always heed the laws: “Let every American . . . swear . . . never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country” (lines 1-4). Even bad laws, he states, “while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed” (lines 30-32). In Passage 2, Thoreau is less rigid in his beliefs regarding the need for individuals to heed the laws of the country, arguing at times that some laws should be broken: “but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law” (lines 64-66). While Lincoln and Thoreau can therefore be said to disagree about the moral imperative to follow existing laws, both passages advance an opinion regarding the need to follow or not follow all of the country’s laws. Choice A is incorrect because the passages are not making arguments about differences between legal duties and moral imperatives but rather are addressing the need to follow (or not) the laws of a land. Choice B is incorrect. Both passages address the question of changing existing laws in the United States, but that is only a minor part of what is a greater debate about the need to follow or not follow existing laws. Choice D is incorrect because neither passage addresses the standards for determining whether or not laws are just, only whether laws should be heeded or not.",false,reading,mcq,
41,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 2, Thoreau says that if a law “is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law” (lines 64-66). It is clear from Passage 1 that Lincoln would reject this stance, as he says individuals should never break the law (“Let every American . . . swear . . . never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country,” lines 1-4) and should wait for a bad law to be repealed (“bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed . . . still while they continue . . . they should be religiously observed,” lines 29-32). Choices A and C are incorrect because in Passage 1, Lincoln is absolutely clear that all laws “should be religiously observed” (line 32); he does not describe anyone’s suggestion to break the law as either excusable (choice A) or honorable (choice C). Choice D is incorrect because it is not supported by the passage, as Lincoln does not discuss the core principles of the Constitution in Passage 1.",false,reading,mcq,
42,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Lincoln uses abolitionism solely as an example to illustrate the argument he is making about heeding the law: “In any case that arises, as for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two positions is necessarily true” (lines 37-39). In Passage 2, Thoreau does the same thing by noting that “those who call themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support . . . from the government” (lines 79-82). Although Lincoln and Thoreau use the cause of abolitionism to argue different points, a commonality they share is that neither embraces the cause personally in the passage; Lincoln simply uses it as an example (“as for instance”) while Thoreau specifically talks of other people “who call themselves Abolitionists.” Choice A is incorrect because in Passage 1, Lincoln argues against drastic action, saying that even in the case of abolitionism, such a response is not “necessary, justifiable, or excusable” (line 44). Choice B is incorrect because it’s not accurate to say abolitionism was central to the arguments, only that each used that subject as an example. Choice C is incorrect because neither Lincoln nor Thoreau offers an opinion about whether or not abolitionism will gain widespread acceptance, instead they incorporate it only as an example in their discussions of just and unjust laws.",false,reading,mcq,

Choices A and D are incorrect because the author does not present himself as either a consumer who plans to buy solar panels or a hobbyist with a personal interest in solar panel technology.

Choice A is incorrect because the passage explains how solar panels work but never states or implies that consumers do not understand the technology. Choice B is incorrect because while the passage explains how two-sided solar cells can increase solar electric output, it does not suggest that they have any existing or possible weaknesses.

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage explains only that two-sided solar panels can raise efficiency by harvesting reflected light, not that they can raise efficiency because they take little energy to operate (choice A), are cost-effective (choice C), or keep sunlight from reaching the ground (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,

Choice A is incorrect because “dabbling in” a subject implies being only minimally involved with it, but in lines 69-71, Green is shown to be committed to silicon use. Choice B is incorrect because in this context the phrase “betting on” is figurative and implies believing in something, not actually being involved with games of chance.

40,C,"Choice C is the best answer because, as the only choice that focuses on Silver Age characters (“the upstarts”), it most logically completes the discussion of the Silver Age. It also provides an effective transition to the next paragraph: by indicating that “the Silver Age drew to a close,” it sets up the next paragraph’s discussion of the Bronze and other ages. Choices A and D are incorrect because each focuses on Golden Age characters and thus fails to logically complete the discussion of the Silver Age. Choice B is incorrect because it prematurely discusses a topic that would be better addressed in the next paragraph.",false,writing,mcq,EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS
41,A,"Choice A is the best answer because the present perfect verb “have yielded” is used correctly to indicate that the action of the sentence began in the past and is ongoing in the present. In this case, the transformation of comics from the Silver Age to subsequent ages began in the past and continues today. Choice B is incorrect because the verb “would have yielded” indicates that an action was possible but never happened. Choice C is incorrect because the past tense verb “were yielding” indicates that the action happened and ended in the past. Choice D is incorrect because the verb “will yield” means that the action will happen in the future, which is not necessarily true.",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
42,D,"Choice D is the best answer because the possessive plural noun “Comics’” and adjective “superhero” appropriately indicate that the “superhero line” is a feature of the comics. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the possessive singular noun “superhero’s” is not correctly used in the sentence. Nothing belongs to a singular “superhero” in the sentence. Furthermore, in choice B, the singular possessive noun “Comic’s” is used incorrectly since more than one comic is being referred to. In choice C, “Comics” is plural, but it needs to be possessive, too.",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
43,A,"Choice A is the best answer because the conjunctive adverb “then” correctly shows that given previously stated information, the conclusion that can be drawn is that the transition between the Golden and Silver Ages of comic books was more successful than others. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not indicate the correct relationship between the information presented earlier and conclusions that can be drawn from the information. “However,” “nevertheless,” and “yet” are ordinarily used to indicate that in spite of some action, a different or unexpected result occurs.",false,writing,mcq,EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS
44,C,"Choice C is the best answer because the singular pronoun “that” agrees in number with its singular antecedent “transition.” Choices A and B are incorrect because the plural pronouns “those” and “these” do not agree with the singular antecedent “transition.” Additionally, choice B is incorrect because “these” implies that whatever is being referred to is at hand, not in the past. Choice D is incorrect because a pronoun is needed to complete the comparison of transitions between comic book ages.",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
