1,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Throughout the passage, the narrator refers to Miss Spivey’s 1938 class as “we” and “us” and describes interactions between Miss Spivey and her students as a firsthand observer, indicating that the narrator was a member of this 1938 class. Therefore, the narrator of the passage can best be described as one of Miss Spivey’s former students. Choice B is incorrect because the narrator refers to Miss Spivey’s predecessor, Miss Chandler, by name, not as “I” or “me,” and therefore the narrator isn’t Miss Spivey’s predecessor. Choice C is incorrect because the passage identifies the narrator as a member of Miss Spivey’s 1938 class and also mentions the narrator’s mother and brother, Ralphord. Choice D is incorrect because the narrator refers to Miss Spivey by name and as “she” and “her,” not as “I” or “me,” and thus can’t be Miss Spivey herself",false,reading,mcq,
2,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The description of the train’s arrival in the first paragraph suggests that Threestep is a rural town: instead of a paved platform, the tracks are lined with “burned grass.” Meanwhile, the description of the school in the sixth paragraph implies that the community is small: instead of individual rooms for separate grade levels, the school’s single room contains twenty-six students spread “across seven grade levels.” Therefore, Threestep is mainly presented in the passage as a small rural town. Choice A is incorrect because the narrator describes Threestep as uncomfortably hot for its residents, not as a summer retreat for vacationers. Choice C is incorrect because Miss Spivey refers to prominent universities located in other cities, not ones located in Threestep. Choice D is incorrect because in the first paragraph Threestep is characterized as a small rural town that is experiencing “hard times,” not as a comfortable suburb.",false,reading,mcq,
3,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In the first paragraph, Miss Spivey remarks that the heat in Georgia is nothing compared to the heat she experienced in Timbuktu. Later in this paragraph the narrator states, “I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else.” Hence it can reasonably be inferred from the passage that some of the people at the train station regard Miss Spivey’s comment about the Georgia heat with resentment because they feel that she is minimizing their discomfort. Choice A is incorrect because Miss Spivey informs the people at the train station that she has experienced even more extreme heat, so they wouldn’t have assumed that she is experiencing intense heat for the first time. Choice B is incorrect because the passage indicates that the people at the station know Miss Spivey is coming to Threestep to work, not that they doubt she will stay there very long. Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn’t indicate that the people at the train station imagine that she is superior to them.",false,reading,mcq,
4,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks what can be inferred from the passage about the reaction of the people at the train station to Miss Spivey’s comment about the Georgia heat. The answer, that it can be reasonably inferred from the passage that some of the people at the train station regard Miss Spivey’s comment about the Georgia heat with resentment because they feel that she’s minimizing their discomfort, is best supported in the first paragraph: “I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Instead, they describe Miss Spivey’s appearance (choice A), reflect on why people viewed her arrival positively in spite of their irritation over her remark (choice C), and outline her education (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
5,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In the second paragraph, Miss Spivey
describes a break she took from her formal education as a “fruitful
intermission.” She explains that she “traveled extensively in the Near
East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother’s, one Janet Miller”
during this time. Therefore, Miss Spivey most likely uses the phrase
“fruitful intermission” to indicate that she benefited from taking time
off from her studies to travel.
Choice B is incorrect because Miss Spivey’s use of the phrase “fruitful
intermission” doesn’t indicate that her travels with Janet Miller
encouraged her to start medical school. Choice C is incorrect because
Miss Spivey uses the phrase “fruitful intermission” to refer to a break
in her formal education after boarding school, not during her early
years there. Choice D is incorrect because Miss Spivey’s use of the
phrase “fruitful intemiission” doesn’t indicate that this break lasted
longer than she had expected.",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
6,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In the second paragraph, Miss Spivey tells her class that she went to Barnard College in New York City, which prompts Ralphord to ask her what she studied at “Barnyard College.” In response, Miss Spivey explains that Barnard College “was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.” This interaction implies that, contrary to Miss Spivey’s expectations, the names of prestigious East Coast schools aren’t common knowledge among her pupils. Thus the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge. Choice B is incorrect because the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord establishes an atmosphere of misunderstanding, not friendliness. Choice C is incorrect because Ralphord’s question demonstrates his naivety rather than his precociousness. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn’t suggest that Ralphord’s question is an attempt to amuse Miss Spivey",false,reading,mcq,
7,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The third paragraph describes Miss

Spivey as having “wandered,” or walked aimlessly, into a lecture

by John Dewey. Following her interactions with the professor,

Miss Spivey was inspired to work as an educator; consequently,

she “marched,” or walked purposefully, to sign up for the Teacher’s

College. Hence, by describing Miss Spivey as having “wandered” in

the former situation and “marched” in the latter, the narrator is most

likely suggesting that Miss Spivey’s initial encounter with Dewey’s

ideas was somewhat accidental but ultimately motivated her to

decisive action.

Choices A and C are incorrect because the narrator’s description

of Miss Spivey as having “wandered” into Dewey’s class and

“marched” to Sign up for the Teacher’s College suggests that her

accidental encounter with him motivated her to begin studying to

be a teacher, not that Dewey saw Miss Spivey as lacking confidence

in her ability to teach (choice A) or that she was anxious to be

in charge of her own classroom (choice C). Choice B is incorrect

because Miss Spivey didn’t express a desire to teach in the poorest,
most remote corner of America until two years after talking with
Dewey over coffee.",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
8,C,"Choice C is the best answer. According to the third paragraph, after two years at the Teacher’s College, Miss Spivey told a woman from the WPA that “she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.” Consequently, “they sent her to Threestep, Georgia,” according to the fourth paragraph. Thus Miss Spivey ended up in Threestep as a direct result of talking with a woman at the WPA. Choices A and B are incorrect because Miss Spivey ended up in Threestep as a direct result of talking with a woman at the WPA, not as an immediate consequence of her friendship with Janet Miller (choice A), or her decision to attend college in New York City (choice B). Choice D is incorrect because Miss Chandler is mentioned as Miss Spivey’s predecessor in Threestep, but Miss Spivey’s arrival in town doesn’t occur as a direct result of Miss Chandler’s retirement.",false,reading,mcq,
9,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The ninth paragraph describes the students’ reaction to Miss Spivey’s announcement that she had seen camels on her trip to Baghdad: “We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up.” Mavis reminds the other students that camels appear in a story they are familiar with. Thus, when Miss Spivey announces that she had seen camels, the students’ reaction suggests that they are baffled. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because when Miss Spivey announces that she had seen camels, the students’ reaction suggests that they are baffled, not delighted (choice A), fascinated (choice B), or worried (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
10,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks what the
students’ reaction suggests about them when Miss Spivey announces
that she had seen camels. The answer, that their reaction suggests that
they are bafiled, is best supported in the ninth paragraph: “We all hung
there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up.”
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide
the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Instead,
they describe Miss Spivey’s anticipation of a delighted or amazed
response to her announcement that she had seen camels (choice A),
relay Mavis’s reference to a story familiar to the students (choice C),
and reflect on the subdued nature of Miss Spivey’s response to Mavis
(choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
11,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Throughout the passage, the author contends that efforts to make driving more unpleasant can curtail the negative environmental effects of car use, such as the rapid growth of “energy-hungry subdivisions.” According to the second paragraph, “one of the few forces with a proven ability to slow the growth of suburban sprawl has been the ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long, annoying commutes.” Consequently, according to the last paragraph, “from an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is a worthy goal.” Thus the main purpose of the passage is to argue that one way to reduce the negative environmental effects of traffic is to make driving less agreeable. Choice A is incorrect because the author introduces the claim that efforts to reduce traffic actually increase traffic as a supporting point, not as the main purpose of the passage. Choice B is incorrect because, in the second paragraph, the author does dispute the environmental value of making car travel more convenient, but this isn’t the main purpose of the passage. Choice C is incorrect because the negative environmental consequences of car-focused development and suburban sprawl are supporting details of the passage, not its main purpose.",false,reading,mcq,
12,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the author states, “Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely clear space on highway lanes for those who would prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has included almost everyone with access to a car.” In this sentence, the author bases his claim about the unintended consequences of building public transit on the expectation that most people would prefer to drive a car than take trains and buses. Hence this sentence best supports the idea that the author assumes that, all things being equal, people would rather drive than take mass transit. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide the best support for the idea that the author assumes that, all things being equal, people would rather drive than take mass transit. Instead, they argue that in order to have positive environmental effects, new transit options have to persuade a substantial number of people not to drive (choice B), contend that unpopular efforts to make driving less convenient are necessary to reduce driving (choice C), and connect increased commute times to a reduction in suburban sprawl (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
13,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The first paragraph states, “That means that a new transit system has to be backed up by something that impels complementary reductions in car use.” In other words, new public transportation initiatives need to be supported, or reinforced, by policies that reduce car use. Thus “backed up,” as used in the passage, most nearly means supported. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of the passage, “backed up” means supported, not copied (choice B), substituted (choice C), or jammed (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
14,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the author introduces some proposals for reducing car traffic by making driving slower and less convenient. However, he also acknowledges that “those ideas are not popular.” Thus, in the first paragraph, the author concedes that his recommendations aren’t widely supported. Choice A is incorrect because, in the first paragraph, the author doesn’t indicate that his recommendations are costly to implement. Choice C is incorrect because the author concedes that his recommendations are unpopular with the general public, not strongly opposed by experts. Choice D is incorrect because the author suggests that his recommendations are environmentally beneficial in the long term, not environmentally harmful in the short term.",false,reading,mcq,
15,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In the second paragraph, the author argues that “if, in a misguided effort to do something of environmental value, municipalities take steps that make long-distance car commuting faster or more convenient . . . we actually make the sprawl problem worse.” That is, measures that make driving more convenient actually harm the environment because they encourage more people to live in suburban developments, which represents wasteful expansion in his view. Therefore, based on the passage, the author would most likely characterize many attempts to improve traffic as well intentioned but ultimately leading to environmental harm. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the author doesn’t characterize attempts to improve traffic as doomed to fail due to drivers’ reluctance to change their behavior (choice A), as overestimating drivers’ tolerance of long commutes (choice B), or as viable only if they make driving more economical and productive (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
16,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The previous question asks how the author would most likely characterize many attempts to improve traffic. The answer, that the author would most likely characterize such attempts as well intentioned but ultimately leading to environmental harm, is best supported in the second paragraph: “If, in a misguided effort to do something of environmental value, municipalities take steps that make long-distance car commuting faster or more convenient—by adding lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control measures that make it possible for existing roads to accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t require drivers even to slow down—we actually make the sprawl problem worse.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Instead, they assert that public transit improvements must be supported by measures to reduce car use (choice A), indicate that tolerance for long commutes has grown recently, but has a natural limit (choice B), and elaborate on why improvements in public transport can fail to decrease road use (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
17,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The second paragraph discusses how efforts to make commuting more convenient can have the unintended consequence of encouraging people to live farther away from their jobs: “If you cut commuting time by 10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each way to work can justify moving five miles farther out, because their travel time won’t change.” Therefore, according to the passage, reducing commuting time for drivers can have the effect of making drivers more willing to live farther from their places of employment. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the passage doesn’t suggest that reducing commuting time can make drivers more productive employees (choice A), can cause mass transit to be extended farther into suburban areas (choice B), or can result in less government funding for mass transit (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
18,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The last paragraph asserts, “No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would make traveling less
convenient.” In other words, nobody advocates, or pushes for, changes
to the transportation system by arguing that they would make traveling
less convenient. Thus “promotes,” as used in the passage, most nearly
means advocates.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in the context of the
passage, “promotes” means advocates, not upgrades (choice A), serves
(choice B), or develops (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
19,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Figure 1 presents data related to the effect of route capacity reduction on selected regions. In the row pertaining to Southampton city center, the number 5,316 appears under the heading “Vehicles per day on altered road” in the column that specifies “Before alteration.” Thus, according to figure 1, the number of vehicles that traveled on the altered road through Southampton city center per day before the route was altered is 5,316. Choice A is incorrect because 3,081 is the number of vehicles per day that traveled on the Southampton city center road after it was altered, not before. Choice C is incorrect because 24,101 is the number of vehicles per day that traveled on roads surrounding the Southampton city center road after it was altered. Choice D is incorrect because 26,522 is the number of vehicles that traveled on roads surrounding the Southampton city center road before it was altered.",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
20,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the author of the passage argues that “to have environmental value . . . a new transit system has to be backed up by something that impels complementary reductions in car use—say, the physical elimination of traffic lanes.” According to figure 1, reducing route capacity resulted in a net reduction in regional traffic in all five areas studied. Therefore, the data in figure 1 support the author’s argument because the data show that reducing road capacity can lead to a net reduction in traffic. Choice A is incorrect. Figure 1 data support the author’s argument that route capacity reduction results in a reduction of car use, but the figure doesn’t provide data relating to the “induced traffic” phenomenon. Choices C and D are incorrect because figure 1 data support, not weaken, the author’s argument that route capacity reduction such as elimination of traffic lanes results in reduction of traffic.",false,reading,mcq,
21,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Figure 2 presents data related to an
opinion poll of transportation engineers. According to the y-axis
label, the engineers were asked whether a significant road space
reallocation could result in people changing various aspects of their
driving. The graph shows four different answer possibilities: “yes,”
“yes (in exceptional circumstances),” “no,” and “don’t know.” The
question asks for the aspect of driver behavior that the engineers
surveyed thought was least likely to change in the event of a
reallocation of road space according to figure 2: when they travel,

their means of traveling, how often they make a journey, or their

driving style. Of these four choices, “their driving style,” received the

smallest percentage of “yes” and “yes (in exceptional circumstances)”

responses and the largest percentage of “no” responses. Hence, based

on figure 2, the engineers surveyed were most skeptical of the idea

that, in the event of a reallocation of road Space, drivers would change

their driving style.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because, according to figure 2,

when the engineers were asked whether they thought that drivers

would change when they travel (choice A), their means of traveling

(choice B), or how often they make a journey (choice C) in the event

of a significant road space reallocation, they gave more “yes” or “yes

(in exceptional circumstances)” answers, and fewer “no” answers

than they gave in response to the question of whether they thought

drivers would change their driving style. Thus the engineers were less

skeptical of these potential changes than they were of the idea that

drivers would change their driving style in the event of a significant

road space reallocation.",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
22,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph asserts that textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that “sensations of pressure and vibration . . . travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers.” Thus, based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected that the ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired as a result of blocking fast fibers. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the passage indicates that textbook authors in the early 1990s believed blocking fast nerve fibers would impair sensations of vibration, not that blocking would increase the firing rate of other fibers (choice A), cause gentle stimuli to be perceived as painful (choice B), or make the body compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
23,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks what
condition textbook authors in the early 19905 would most likely have
expected to result from blocking fast fibers. The answer, that they
would most likely have expected blocking fast fibers to result in an
impairment of the ability to perceive vibrations, is best supported in
the first paragraph, which refers to the views of textbook authors in
the early 19905: “Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed
to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location.”
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t
provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question.
Instead, they assert that textbook authors in the early 19905 believed
slow-conducting nerves responded only to pain and temperature
stimuli (choice A), noted that blocking slow fibers only seemed to
reduce sensitivity to warmth or small painful shocks (choice C), and
knew that fast-conducting fibers responded to touch at a signal rate of
35 to 75 m/s (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
24,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The second paragraph states, “Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals.” In other words, the researchers wondered if these nerves were present, or existent, in humans and other mammals. Therefore, in the context of the passage, the word “active” most nearly means present. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of the passage, “active” most nearly means present, not attentive (choice B), movable (choice C), or restless (choice D)",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
25,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The second paragraph states, “Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves fired.” In other words, the researchers used the technique known as microneurography to record, or register, the electrical signals sent by nerve fibers. Therefore, in the context of the passage, the word “capture” most nearly means record. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in the context of the passage, “capture” most nearly means record, not occupy (choice A), seize (choice B), or influence (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
26,C,"Choice C is the best answer. According to the passage, different types

of nerve fibers carry signals at different speeds, either fast or slow.

The second paragraph outlines a study led by Haikan Olausson in 1993

that measured the response time of nerves when exposed to gentle

pressure. Olausson and his team found that “soft stroking prompted

two different signals” in test subjects’ nerve fibers, “one immediate

and one delayed.” Therefore, the conclusion that is best supported by

the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment is that gentle pressure is

sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.

Choices A and D are incorrect because according to the passage,

Olausson’s 1993 study didn’t compare how signal speed was affected

by stimulation in difierent bodily areas (choice A) or by difierent

amounts of pressure applied to the nerve (choice D). Choice B is
incorrect because the passage notes that only human hairy skin
contains slow nerve fibers, not that hair causes signal speeds to slow.",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
27,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks which conclusion is best supported by the findings of Olausson’s 1993 experiment. The answer, that Olausson’s 1993 experiment best supports the conclusion that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers, is best supported in the second paragraph: Olausson’s team “showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Instead, they describe a technique used by Olausson’s team (choice A), quantify the amount of time between the fast signals and the slow signals observed by Olausson’s team (choice C), and introduce a further study conducted by Olausson’s team in 1999 (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
28,D,"Choice D is the best answer. This sentence from the fourth paragraph outlines a quandary that arose from the 1999 study conducted by Olausson’s team: “But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying.” The passage presents this line of inquiry as a justification for the team’s subsequent research on CT fibers. Thus this sentence serves mainly to show a problem from the perspective of Olausson’s team. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. The cited lines serve mainly to show a problem from the perspective of Olausson’s team, not to identify factors Olausson had previously failed to consider (choice A), propose a solution to a dilemma encountered by Olausson (choice B), or anticipate a potential criticism of Olausson by the reader (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
29,A,"Choice A is the best answer. According to the fifth paragraph,
Olausson set out to discover, in his team’s 1999 research, whether a CT
nerve “can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether
it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather.
Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?”
Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that one of the intended
goals of the 1999 experiment was to determine the precise nature of
sensations that CT fibers can convey.
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in their 1999 research,
Olausson’s team didn’t seek to determine the relationship between
human body hair and CT fiber function (choice B), the role played
by CT fibers in the perception of pain (choice C), or the effects of
microneurography on CT fiber signaling (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
30,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In the 1999 study, Olausson’s team conducted experiments on a patient known as G.L. The researchers wanted to learn more about what type of sensations slow-conducting CT nerve fibers transmit, and G.L. was of special interest to them, according to the sixth paragraph: “More than 2 decades earlier . . . she had lost responsiveness to pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s quick-conducting fibers were gone. . . . But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated fibers were intact.” The fact that G.L.’s slow-conducting fibers were still intact while her other nerves were unresponsive allowed Olausson’s team to study her slow-conducting CT fibers in isolation. Thus the main purpose of the sixth paragraph is to indicate why G.L.’s medical condition was of value to Olausson’s experiment. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the sixth paragraph doesn’t indicate that Olausson’s team set out to relieve any of the neurological conditions that G.L. exhibited (choice A), compare G.L.’s nerve function with that of other adults (choice B), or detail any procedures that G.L. had experienced during previous experiments (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
31,A,"Choice A is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, “in normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated [by gentle brushing], but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers brushed G.L.’s arm.” Therefore, according to the passage, G.L. differed from Olausson’s other test subjects in terms of the number of cortices activated in the brain during gentle brushing. Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn’t address the physical dimensions of the somatosensory cortex in G.L. or other test subjects. Choice C is incorrect because G.L. differed from other test subjects in terms of the number of cortices activated in the brain during gentle brushing, not in terms of the intensity of nerve signals required to activate the insular cortex. Choice D is incorrect because MRI scanning is discussed in the passage as a method used to locate brain activity, not as a focus of study in Olausson’s research.",false,reading,mcq,
32,B,"Choice B is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, Olausson’s 1999 research, in which CT fibers were stimulated, “solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch.” Hence humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, according to the passage. Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn’t indicate that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Choice C is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.’s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn’t suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch. Choice D is incorrect because the passage indicates that CT fibers transmit an emotional aspect of touch rather than conscious aspects of sensation, not that humans must ignore the conscious aspects of sensation in order to experience the emotional aspects of touch.",false,reading,mcq,
33,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1, Beveridge portrays America as “a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the countries of Europe.” Thus, in Passage 1, Beveridge asserts that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a divine gift to the American people. Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge envisions Americans occupying foreign lands, not being subject to foreign invasion; moreover, he asserts that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a divine gift, not a safeguard against invasion. Choice B is incorrect because Beveridge asserts that American society constitutes an improvement on English society, not that the resources and immensity of the United States replicate conditions in Europe. Choice D is incorrect because Beveridge doesn’t assert that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a source of envy for people in other countries.",false,reading,mcq,
34,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 1,
Beveridge commands his audience several times to think of a future
in which American laws and customs have been extended to foreign
countries, leading American citizens to move to those places.
According to Beveridge, this will provide Hawaii and Puerto Rico
with “justice and safety,” the Philippines with “order and equity,” and
Cuba with a “civilization of energy and industry.” Thus, in the second
paragraph of Passage 1, the commands given by Beveridge mainly
serve to anticipate the benefits of a proposed policy.
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because Beveridge’s commands
serve to anticipate the benefits of a proposed foreign policy, not to
remind the audience of its civic responsibilities (choice A), emphasize
the urgency of a national problem (choice C), or refute an argument
advanced by opponents (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
35,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The fourth paragraph of Passage 2 asserts that “a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence.” In other words, when a true idea has been introduced to the world, it can never be retracted, or taken back. Therefore, in the context of the passage, the word “recalled” most nearly means retracted.

36,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan argues that the principle of self-rule set forth in the Declaration of Independence is, in fact, a value that all people instinctively aspire to. Indeed, for Bryan, “[God] never made a race of people so low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.” Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan considers the preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule to be a manifestation of an innate drive in humans toward self-rule. Choices A and C are incorrect because it can reasonably be inferred that Bryan considers the preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule to be a manifestation of a universal drive in humans that’s independent of circumstances, not a reaction to the excesses of imperial governments in the modern era (choice A) or a testament to the effects of the foreign policy of the United States (choice C).

37,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The previous question asks what can
reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 about Bryan’s views on the
preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule. The answer,
that Bryan considers the preference to be a manifestation of an innate
drive in humans toward self-rule, is best supported in the fourth
paragraph of Passage 2: “[God] never made a race of people so low
in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a
foreign master.”
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide
the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Instead,
they indicate that explicitly promoting imperialism would run counter
to the words of American founding father Patrick Henry (choice A),
assert that once a truth is uttered, its influence will continually grow
(choice B), and introduce the notion that, in Bryan’s view, an imperial
project in the Philippines would hurt not only the people of that nation
but also the people of the United States (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
38,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The last paragraph of Passage 2 states, “Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also calculate its effects upon our own nation.” In other words, proponents of imperial conquest must evaluate, or assess, the consequences of this policy for the United States. Therefore, in the context of the passage, the word “calculate” most nearly means evaluate.

39,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1, Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as “a glorious history” that was bestowed upon God’s “chosen people,” a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and “statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands.” Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, “Our whole history has been an encouragement . . . to all who are denied a voice in their own government.” Bryan goes on to extol the virtues of several figures who were instrumental in the founding of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Hence, in developing their respective arguments, Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States. Choice B is incorrect because neither Bryan, in Passage 1, nor Beveridge, in Passage 2, expresses admiration for the vibrancy and diversity of American culture. Choice C is incorrect because Bryan expresses admiration for the worldwide history of struggles for independence, but Beveridge doesn’t. Choice D is incorrect because Beveridge expresses admiration for the idealism that permeates many aspects of American society, but Bryan doesn’t.",false,reading,mcq,
40,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1, Beveridge argues that Americans are “imperial by virtue of their power” and are therefore justified in being “the propagandists . . . of liberty.” In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, “We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here”; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion. Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn’t present the concept of liberty as it’s realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice C is incorrect because Beveridge doesn’t argue that the concept of liberty as it’s realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is incorrect because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it’s realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States.",false,reading,mcq,
41,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because, in Passage 2, Bryan doesn’t imply that Beveridge’s vision of American governance of island territories is unrealistic due to most Americans’ unwillingness to relocate to distant islands (choice A), deceptive due to the fact that economic domination would be the true goal of the American government (choice B), or impractical due to the islanders’ insistence upon an equal distribution of resources (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,
42,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The previous question asks what criticism Bryan would most likely make of Beveridge’s vision of American governance of island territories. The answer, that Bryan would criticize this vision for being naive, since islanders would object to being governed by Americans, is best supported by the first paragraph of Passage 2: “If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.” Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Instead, they assert that the people of the Philippines don’t need encouragement from Americans to resist imperialism (choice B), state that American history encourages resistance to imperialism by all people, including the people of the Philippines (choice C), and note the enduring resonance of Patrick Henry’s famous quote about liberty (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
43,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The passage summarizes research on the relationship between plowing and weed growth. According to the fourth paragraph, the research of Karl Hartmann suggests that plowing fields during the day leads to weed growth because exposure to even small amounts of light can “induce seed germination,” or cause seeds to sprout. Thus, according to the passage, exposure to light allows seeds to begin to develop. Choices B and D are incorrect because the passage indicates that small amounts of light cause seeds to sprout, but it doesn’t explicitly assert that light exposure allows seeds to absorb necessary nutrients (choice B) and doesn’t discuss whether light exposure helps seeds achieve maximum growth (choice D). Choice C is incorrect because the passage doesn’t indicate that light exposure can help seeds withstand extreme temperatures.",false,reading,mcq,
44,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of the passage,

the following question is posed: “Do the blades of a plow, which can

reach more than a foot beneath the soil surface, bring some of these

buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by

exposure to sunlight?” The passage goes on to describe research

conducted both in the laboratory and in the field that sought to

answer this question. Hence the question in the second paragraph

primarily serves to introduce the specific research topic addressed in

the passage.

Choice A is incorrect because the question in the second paragraph
doesn’t primarily serve to emphasize the provisional nature of the
findings discussed in the passage. Sauer and Struik’s 19605 lab
experiments, described in the third paragraph, produced findings
that could be characterized as provisional; however, Karl Hartmann’s
research described in the fourth paragraph clearly demonstrated
that plowing at night can be an efiective way to reduce weed growth.
Choice C is incorrect because the impact of the studies analyzed in
the passage has been real and practical, not hypothetical. Choice D
is incorrect because the question in the second paragraph doesn’t
indicate that there is any significant disagreement about the methods
explored in the passage.",false,reading,mcq,
45,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The last sentence of the second paragraph asks, “Do the blades of a plow . . . bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?” In other words, does some farm equipment bring buried seeds to the surface where their sprouting is stimulated, or activated, by exposure to sunlight? Therefore, in the context of the passage, the word “induced” most nearly means stimulated. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in the context of the passage, “induced” most nearly means stimulated, not lured (choice A), established (choice B), or convinced (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
46,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The question asks which selection from the passage best supports the idea that seeds present in fields plowed at night are exposed to some amount of light. The fourth paragraph asserts that plowing at night can reduce the germination of weed seeds. The paragraph concludes that “although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.” Thus this sentence best supports the idea that seeds present in fields plowed at night are exposed to some amount of light. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide the best support for the idea that seeds present in fields plowed at night are exposed to some amount of light. Instead, they relay Hartmann’s initial reasoning about seed exposure to light in fields plowed during the day (choice A), affirm that even minute durations of sunlight exposure can induce seed germination (choice B), and explain Hartmann’s initial skepticism regarding his own idea about the effectiveness of nighttime plowing as a weed deterrent (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
47,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, “no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.” Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann’s experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found. Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn’t have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice C is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice D is incorrect. Hartmann’s original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn’t have been comparable with Hartmann’s original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",false,reading,mcq,
48,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks what the passage suggests about the percentage of surface that would have been covered with weeds if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann’s experiment. The answer, that the percentage of surface with weeds would have been lower than the percentage Hartmann found, is best supported in the sixth paragraph: “No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Instead, they describe the conditions of Hartmann’s experiment (choice A), characterize the results of the experiment as dramatic (choice C), and report the results of the experiment (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,

to Hartmann’s experiment, “The results were dramatic. More than
80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by
weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was
covered by weeds.” In other words, the outcome of the experiment was
impressive, or striking. Therefore, in the context of the passage, the

The data presented in the table show that in nine of the ten soil samples studied, fewer weeds grew in the soil when it was disturbed in darkness than when it was disturbed in light.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the cited lines aren’t directly supported by the data presented in the table. While the findings in the table report on weed growth in soil stirred up during the day and night, these lines discuss the prehistoric use of plowing to control weeds (choice A), the number of weed seeds buried beneath the soil surface (choice B), and the depth at which seeds are buried that prevents them from germinating (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,

33,A,"Choice A is the best answer. No change is needed because this choice
concludes the passage by recalling a topic from the first paragraph
that requires additional research: scientists’ enduring question about
how the left and right hemispheres of marsupials’ brains cormnunicate
since these mammals lack a corpus callosum.
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because none of these choices
concludes the passage by recalling a topic from the first paragraph
that requires additional research. The first paragraph doesn’t refer to
the minority of humans who are left handed, the fact that studies like
this one may someday yield insights into the causes of neurological
disorders, or an additional study to examine handedness in other
animals that sometimes stand upright.",false,writing,mcq,EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS 
34,C,"Choice C is the best answer. “Although these levels are impressive” provides the most effective transition from the previous sentence, which indicates the percent of surveyed companies that provide employees with tuition assistance, to the information that follows in this sentence, that even more companies should consider providing such assistance. Choice A is incorrect because “despite these findings” suggests that regardless of the percentages, more companies should consider providing tuition assistance, which is illogical. Choice B is incorrect because the information that follows in the sentence isn’t additional to the 2014 study. Choice D is incorrect because the issue of whether companies want or don’t want to provide tuition assistance isn’t mentioned in the previous sentence.",false,writing,mcq,EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS 
35,D,"Choice D is the best answer. This choice most effectively establishes the main idea of the passage, which is that companies should offer tuition assistance because doing so helps attract and retain employees. This main idea is supported in the second paragraph, which argues that tuition assistance appeals to highly motivated and disciplined individuals, and in the third paragraph, which claims that employees receiving tuition assistance often stay with their employers even after they complete their degrees. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they don’t establish the passage’s main idea. The passage isn’t about increasing customer satisfaction, solving the problem of rising tuition costs, or strengthening the US economy.",false,writing,mcq,"COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE,

36,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The plural noun “workers” correctly
indicates that companies have more than one worker. The plural
noun “opportunities” indicates that employers ofier workers multiple
chances for personal and professional development.
Choices A and B are incorrect because the plural possessive
nouns “workers’” and “opportunities’” should be the plural nouns
“workers” and “opportunities,” since nothing belongs to the workers
or opportunities in the sentence. Choice D is incorrect because the
singular nouns “worker” and “opportunity” should be plural, and the
apostrophes indicating possession aren’t needed.",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
37,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The main verb “stressed” provides a simple predicate for the subject “John Fox” to create a grammatically complete sentence. Choices A and C are incorrect because “who stressed” and “stressing” leave the sentence without an independent clause. Choice D is incorrect because although “he stressed” gives the sentence an independent clause, that clause is improperly joined by “and” to the phrases “John Fox” and “the director of dealer training at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in the United States.”",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
38,C,"Choice C is the best answer. This choice most effectively combines the sentences at the underlined portion because the pronoun “which” creates a relative clause (“which . . . workers”) that clearly and concisely describes “retain.” Choice A is incorrect because “retention” repeats the idea of “retain,” which is already mentioned in the sentence. Choice B is incorrect because “retaining” repeats the idea of “retain,” and the pronoun “whom” repeats the idea of “employees.” Choice D is incorrect because the pronoun “that” doesn’t have a clear antecedent and therefore creates a vague sentence.",false,writing,mcq,"WORDS_IN_CONTEXT,

39,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The subordinate conjunction “because” begins the dependent clause “because their new qualifications give them opportunities for advancement within the company.” No punctuation is needed to separate this dependent clause from the independent clause that directly precedes it. Choices A and D are incorrect because placing a period or a semicolon after “degrees” results in a rhetorically ineffective sentence fragment. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the noun and subordinate conjunction. (Although colons can be used to introduce additional explanatory information in a sentence, they’re not typically used between a main clause and a dependent clause beginning with a subordinate conjunction such as “because.”)",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
40,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The comma after “(UTC)” is paired
correctly with the comma after “Lincoln" to set off grammatically
nonessential information. The information between the commas, which
describes who Valerie Lincoln is, could be removed and the sentence
would still make sense.
Choice A is incorrect because a comma is needed after “(UTC)” to
set off the grammatically nonessential phrase. Choices B and C are
incorrect because neither a dash nor a colon can be paired with a
comma to set off grammatically nonessential information.",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
41,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The adjective “deep” is used idiomatically with “knowledge” to indicate that Lincoln possessed extensive, in-depth information about her industry. Choice B is incorrect because “hidden” doesn’t make sense within the context of the sentence. A person whose knowledge is hidden wouldn’t be an asset to a company. Choices C and D are incorrect because “large” and “spacious” aren’t idiomatic when describing the extent of a person’s knowledge.",false,writing,mcq,"WORDS_IN_CONTEXT,
EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS"
42,D,"Choice D is the best answer. “Keeping down costs” clearly and concisely identifies what businesses have succeeded in doing. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they’re redundant. In choice A, the verbs “minimizing” and “keeping down” are synonyms, so only one is needed in the sentence. In choice B, “employees’ coursework” isn’t needed because this phrase already appears in the sentence. In choice C, “being effective” repeats the idea of “succeeded,” which appears earlier in the sentence.",false,writing,mcq,"WORDS_IN_CONTEXT,
EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS"
43,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The infinitive “[to] divert” is grammatically correct when preceded by “are likely,” indicating that classes can redirect employees’ time and energy away from their jobs. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because “diverted,” “in diverting,” and “diversions for” create ungrammatical sentences.",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
44,D,"Choice D is the best answer. To make the passage most logical, the sentence should be placed after the last sentence of paragraph 4. The use of “still” in the inserted sentence indicates that a contrast to what was stated previously will follow. Paragraph 4 ends by stating that tuition reimbursement may not be appropriate in all cases, and the inserted sentence indicates that despite this fact, employers should give serious thought to investing in reimbursement programs. Moreover, the inserted sentence restates the passage’s main claim and, therefore, effectively concludes the passage. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because placing the sentence at the end of paragraph 1, 2, or 3 would result in an illogical passage.",false,writing,mcq,EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS
