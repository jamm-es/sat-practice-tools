1,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The narrator initially expresses uncertainty, or uneasiness, over his decision to set out for the North Pole: “my motives in this undertaking are not entirely clear” (lines 9-10). At the end of the passage, the narrator recognizes that because of this journey he is “on the brink of knowing . . . not an ethereal mathematical spot,” the North Pole, but himself (lines 56-57). Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the narrator does not suggest that he fears going on the expedition, doubts his own abilities, or feels disdain for the North Pole.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
2,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Lines 56-57 provide evidence that the narrator eventually recognizes his motives for traveling to the North Pole: “What I am on the brink of knowing, I now see, is not an ephemeral mathematical spot but myself.” The narrator initially was unsure of why he was traveling to the North Pole, but realizes that he has embarked on a journey to find himself. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not provide the best evidence that the narrator eventually recognizes his motives for traveling to the North Pole. Rather, choices A, B, and C all focus on the narrator’s preparations and expectations for the journey",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
3,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 1-6, the narrator says that he feels a “vast yearning” and that his emotions are “complicated.” He explains that he does “not understand quite what it is that the yearning desires.” In this context, his emotions are “not readily verifiable,” or not completely understood. 2 Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in this context, “not readily verifiable” does not mean unable to be authenticated, likely to be contradicted, or without empirical support.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
4,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 10-13, the narrator explains that “the machinery of [his] destiny has worked in secret” to prepare him for this journey, as “its clockwork” has propelled him to “this time and place.” By using the phrases “the machinery” and “its clockwork,” the narrator is showing that powerful and independent forces are causing him to journey to the North Pole. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not indicate the main purpose of lines 10-13. While lines 10-13 mention that these powerful and independent forces have been working “for years, for a lifetime” to convince the narrator to journey to the North Pole, they do not expose a hidden side of the narrator, demonstrate the narrator’s manner, or explain the amount of time the narrator has spent preparing for his expedition.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
5,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 20-21, the narrator states that many people have perished while journeying to the North Pole: “Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have died.” Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the narrator does not indicate that previous explorers have made surprising discoveries, have failed to determine the exact location of the North Pole, or had different motivations than his own.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
6,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 20-21, the narrator provides evidence that many previous explorers seeking the North Pole have perished in the attempt: “Nobody has succeeded in this thing, and many have died.” Choices B, C, and D do not mention previous explorers; therefore, these lines do not provide the best evidence that explorers died while seeking the North Pole.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
7,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In lines 27-39, the narrator states that he is “intent” on traveling to the North Pole but acknowledges that the journey is absurd: “Who wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like a railway?” By asking these questions, the narrator recognizes that the North Pole has no practical value. 3 Still, the narrator admits that finding the North Pole is necessary, as it “must nevertheless be sought for.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the narrator does not view his expedition to the North Pole as immoral, socially beneficial, or scientifically important.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
8,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 27-31, the narrator asks a series of rhetorical questions about the North Pole: “Who wants the North Pole! What good is it! Can you eat it? Will it carry you from Gothenburg to Malmö like a railway?” In this context, the narrator is suggesting that reaching the North Pole has no foreseeable benefit or value to humanity; unlike trains that bring travelers to specific destinations, the North Pole does not provide humans with a specific benefit or form of convenience. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the question posed in lines 30-31 does not debate modes of travel, examine the proximity of cities that can be reached by trains, or question how often people travel.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
9,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 48-49, the narrator states that the North Pole “is an abstraction, a mathematical fiction” and that “no one but a Swedish madman could take the slightest interest in it.” In this context, the narrator is stating that people would not “take the slightest interest in,” or be curious about, the North Pole. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in this context, “take the slightest interest in” does not mean to accept responsibility for, to possess little regard for, or to pay no attention to something.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
10,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 49-51, the narrator describes his balloon journey toward the North Pole: “The wind is still from the south, bearing us steadily northward at the speed of a trotting dog.” In this context, the wind is “bearing,” or carrying, the narrator in a direction to the North. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in this context, “bearing” does not mean affecting, yielding, or enduring.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
11,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The author states that “demographic inversion is not a proxy for population growth” (lines 32-33). In other words, demographic inversion is distinct from population growth. The author also notes that demographic inversion is evident in many American cities, as it 4 “can occur in cities that are growing, those whose numbers are flat, and even in those undergoing a modest decline in size” (lines 33-35). Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not summarize the first paragraph.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
12,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The author notes that one of “the most powerful demographic events of the past decade [was] the movement of African Americans out of central cities” (lines 14-17). Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the author does not state that the unemployed, immigrants, or young professionals moved away from centralcity areas in large numbers in the early 2000s.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
13,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The author states that democratic inversion “can occur in cities that are growing, those whose numbers are flat, and even in those undergoing a modest decline in size” (lines 33-35). In this context, cities whose “numbers,” or population size, are “flat” have static, or unchanging, populations. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in this context, “flat” does not mean deflated, featureless, or obscure.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
14,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The author states that many major American cities are currently experiencing economic hardship, or “enormous fiscal problems,” because of “public pension obligations they incurred in the more prosperous years of the past two decades” (lines 36-39). The author then provides the example of Chicago, a city that can no longer afford to pay the “public services to which most of [its] citizens have grown to feel entitled” (lines 41-43). The author is arguing that many major American cities face economic hardship due to past promises (such as public services) they made to their constituents. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage does not discuss expected tax increases, an inner-city tax base, or manufacturing production as they relate to the financial status of many major American cities.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
15,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 36-39, the author provides evidence that many major American cities are currently experiencing economic hardship due to promises made in past years: “America’s major cities face enormous fiscal problems, many of them the result of public pension obligations 5 they incurred in the more prosperous years of the past two decades.” America’s major cities made past promises, such as “public pension obligations,” to their citizens, which caused their current financial situation. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not provide evidence that many major American cities are currently experiencing economic hardship due to promises made in past years.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
16,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The author explains how sociologist Ernest W. Burgess determined that urban areas have a traditional four-zone structure (lines 54-63). He then states that Burgess was “right about the urban America of 1974” (line 65) as it also followed the traditional four-zone structure: “Virtually every city in the country had a downtown, where the commercial life of the metropolis was conducted; it had a factory district just beyond; it had districts of working-class residences just beyond that; and it had residential suburbs for the wealthy and the upper middle class at the far end of the continuum” (lines 66-71). Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the passage does not imply that American cities in 1974 were witnessing the flight of minority populations to the suburbs, had begun to lose their manufacturing sectors, or were already experiencing demographic inversion.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
17,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 66-71, the author provides evidence that American cities in 1974 had a traditional four-zone structure: “Virtually every city in the country had a downtown, where the commercial life of the metropolis was conducted; it had a factory district just beyond; it had districts of working-class residences just beyond that; and it had residential suburbs for the wealthy and the upper middle class at the far end of the continuum.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not provide evidence that American urban cities in 1974 had a traditional four-zone structure. Choice A references a seminal paper on the layout of American cities, choice B identifies Burgess’s original theory, and choice D focuses on movement to the suburbs.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
18,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 66-68, the author notes that American cities in 1974 each had a “downtown, where the commercial life of the metropolis was conducted.” In this context, the author is stating that these cities “conducted,” or carried out, business, the “commercial life,” in downtown areas. 6 Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in this context, “conducted” does not mean supervised, regulated, or inhibited.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
19,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Chart 1 shows the percentage of the US population in 2010 that lived in non-metro, small metro, and large metro areas. While the author cites census numbers, he notes that “when it comes to measuring demographic inversion, raw census numbers are an ineffective blunt instrument” (lines 11-13). Census data refer to the number of people living in a specific area and the demographic information that’s been collected on them. The author would most likely consider the information in chart 1 to be possibly accurate but an “ineffective blunt instrument” that’s not truly informative. Choices A and C are incorrect because the author would not consider census data to be excellent or compelling. Choice D is incorrect because while the author does not believe the census completely explains demographic inversion, he would be unlikely to disagree with the census data.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
20,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Chart 2 shows that the growth of all metropolitan areas in the 1990s was higher than the growth in all metropolitan areas in the 2000s: large metro areas experienced a growth of 14.3% in the 1990s versus a growth of 10.9% in the 2000s, small metro areas experienced a growth of 13.1% in the 1990s versus a growth of 10.3% in the 2000s, and non-metro areas experienced a growth of 9.0% in the 1990s versus a growth of 4.5% in the 2000s. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately characterize the US growth rate by metro size from 2000-2010 as illustrated in chart 2",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
21,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Chart 2 shows that in the 1990s the US population increased in large metro, small metro, and non-metro areas when compared to the population growth experienced in the 1980s. Large metro areas experienced a growth of 12.5% in the 1980s versus a growth of 14.3% in the 1990s, small metro areas experienced a growth of 8.8% in the 1980s versus a growth of 13.1% in the 1990s, and non-metro areas experienced a growth of 1.8% in the 1980s versus a growth of 9.0% in the 1990s. Given this information, the population grew more in all metro areas in the 1990s when compared to the growth of those areas in the 1980s. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not draw an accurate conclusion about the US growth rate in the 1990s.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
22,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Lines 9-11 introduce the focus of the passage: “Welcome to the world of ‘pharming,’ in which simple genetic tweaks turn animals into living pharmaceutical factories.” The passage then discusses the chronological development of “pharming,” and describes ATryn, a useful drug produced after decades of laboratory experiments. Choices B and C are incorrect because the passage does not primarily evaluate research or summarize long-term research findings. Choice D is incorrect because “pharming” is not a branch of scientific study.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
23,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The author is appreciative of pharming and describes it as turning “animals into living pharmaceutical factories” (lines 10-11). She expresses a positive view of pharming in line 70, when she describes its end result: “Et voilà—human medicine!” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the author’s attitude about pharming is not accurately characterized as one of fear, disinterest, or surprise.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
24,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 19-21, the author explains that dairy animals are “expert,” or capable, “protein producers.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in this context “expert” does not mean knowledgeable, professional, or trained.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
25,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In line 36, the author explains that the initial transgenic studies were “lab-bound thought experiments come true.” Those first studies, in other words, were considered to be of theoretical value only. They were not expected to yield products ready for human use. Choices A and D are incorrect because the cost of animal research and the molecular properties of certain animals are not discussed in the passage. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that all of the transgenic studies were focused on anticoagulants.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
26,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 35-36, the author provides evidence that the transgenic studies done in the 1980s and 1990s were not expected to yield products ready for human use. The author explains that the initial transgenic studies were “merely gee-whiz, scientific geekery, lab-bound thought experiments come true.” 8 Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not provide evidence that the transgenic studies done in the 1980s and 1990s were not expected to yield products ready for human use. Choices A and B do not address the transgenic studies, and choice D focuses on ATryn, a drug that was intended for human use.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
27,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Lines 42-44 explain that ATryn “acts as a molecular bouncer, sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting them out of the bloodstream.” Antithrombin can thus be seen as an agent that reduces the amount of dangerous clots in the bloodstream. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the passage does not suggest that antithrombin stems from a rare genetic mutation, is a sequence of DNA, or occurs naturally in goats’ mammary glands.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
28,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Lines 42-44 provide evidence that antithrombin reduces compounds that lead to blood clots, as it acts as a “molecular bouncer, sidling up to clot-forming compounds and escorting them out of the bloodstream.” Choices A, C, and D do not provide evidence that antithrombin reduces compounds that lead to blood clots; these lines describe proteins, people unable to produce antithrombin, and the production of ATryn.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
29,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In lines 60-62, the description of female goats’ kids mentions that “some of them proved to be transgenic, the human gene nestled safely in their cells.” The statement “some of them” indicates that while a number of the newborn goats were transgenic, others were not. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the female goats used in the initial experiment secreted antithrombin in their milk after giving birth, were the first animals to receive the microinjections, or had cells that contained genes usually found in humans.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
30,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 63-64, the parenthetical is added after the phrase “a promoter,” which is “(. . . a sequence of DNA that controls gene activity).” The parenthetical’s purpose is to define the term “promoter.” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not correctly identify the purpose of the parenthetical information in lines 63-64.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
31,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Gold is a valuable element that commands high prices, so calling something “liquid gold” implies that it has great value. Because the pharmaceutical company GTC was producing the drug in order to sell it, it can be inferred that describing ATryn as “liquid gold” means it proved to be a lucrative product for GTC. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the phrase “liquid gold” does not refer to the microinjection technique, efficiency in dairy production, or transgenic goats being beneficial to dairy farmers.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
32,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 25-29, Burke describes the contract between a person and society as one that is “not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.” Describing that contract as a partnership in all things indicates its seriousness, while describing it as not being a “temporary and perishable nature” implies its permanence. Choice A is incorrect because line 27 states that the contract between a person and society is not “temporary or perishable,” meaning it is not brief. Choices B and C are incorrect because the passage does not compare the contracts in terms of complexity or precision.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
33,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 1-9, Burke explains that people have “consecrated the state” to “avoid . . . the evils of inconstancy and versatility,” and that people should examine “the faults of the state . . . with pious awe and trembling solitude.” Burke then explains that society is taught to “look with horror on those children of their country who want to hack that aged parent in pieces” (lines 10-12). Burke is arguing that children want to revise the state, or “this aged parent,” by amending its faults. In this context, “state” refers to a political entity, or government, that attempts to protect its citizens from “the evils of inconstancy and versatility.” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in this context, “state” does not mean style of living, position in life, or temporary condition.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
34,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 17-29, Burke argues that “subordinate contracts,” are simply business agreements over traded goods, while the state is not merely “a partnership agreement in a trade . . . or some other such low concern . . . but a partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; 10 a partnership in every virtue, and in all perfection.” In this context, Burke is stating that the state is not a contract consisting of “low” or petty concerns. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in this context, “low” does not mean weak, inadequate, or depleted.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
35,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 41-43, Paine asserts that “Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which preceded it.” He later states that deceased citizens of a state should no longer have “any authority in directing who shall be its governors, or how its government shall be organized, or how administered” (lines 61-63). Paine doesn’t believe, in other words, that the decisions of previous generations should dictate the conditions of modern life and government. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not accurately characterize the way Paine views historical precedents.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
36,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In lines 30-34, Burke describes societal contracts as long-term agreements that preserve the interests of past generations and link the living and the dead into a “partnership.” Paine, however, states that past generations have no “control” over the decisions made by living (line 71) because the dead have “no longer any participation in the concerns of this world” (lines 59-60). Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately characterize how Paine would respond to Burke’s claim that societal contracts link past and current generations.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
37,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Lines 67-72 provide the best evidence that Paine would respond to Burke’s statement that society is a “partnership” between past and current generations (lines 30-34) with the explanation that the current generation cannot know what judgments the dead would make about contemporary issues. In these lines Paine explains: “What possible obligation, then, can exist between them; what rule or principle can be laid down, that two nonentities, the one out of existence, and the other not in, and who never can meet in this world, that the one should control the other to the end of time?” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the lines cited do not provide the best evidence that Paine would respond to Burke’s statement that society is a “partnership” between past and current generations (lines 30-34) by arguing that the current generation cannot know what judgments the dead would make about contemporary issues.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
38,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Paine concludes Passage 2 with the argument that because social issues change over time, the living should not try to adhere to decisions made by former generations (lines 73-80). Burke, however, states that living citizens exist within a “universal kingdom” (line 35) comprised of the living, the dead, and those who are not yet born. Burke argues that the living do not have the right to change their government based on “their speculations of a contingent improvement” (lines 36-37). Therefore, Burke would disapprove of Paine’s concluding argument, as he believes the living do not have sufficient justification for changing the existing governmental structure. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not accurately describe how Burke would likely have responded to Paine’s remarks in the final paragraph of Passage 2.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
39,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Lines 34-38 provide the best evidence that Burke would disapprove of Paine’s remarks in the final paragraph of Passage 2: “The municipal corporations of that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at [the living’s] pleasure, and on their speculations of a contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear asunder the bands of their subordinate community.” In these lines, Burke is arguing that the living do not have sufficient justification to change the existing governmental structure.

40,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The primary argument of Passage 1 is that an inviolable contract exists between a people and its government, one that is to be “looked on with other reverence” (lines 24-25). Passage 1 suggests that this contract exists between past and future generations as well; in effect, current and future generations should be governed by decisions made in the past. Passage 2 challenges these points, as it argues that current and future generations are not obligated to preserve past generations’ beliefs: “The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of any other period, had no more right to dispose of the people of the present day, or to bind or to control them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind, or control those who are to live a hundred or a thousand years hence” (lines 48-54). 12 Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Passage 2 does not offer an alternative approach to Passage 1, support an idea introduced in Passage 1, or exemplify an attitude promoted in Passage 1.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
41,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Passage 1 argues that the government is sacred (lines 3-6) and that no person should interfere with it (lines 6-9). Passage 2 argues that people have the right to make changes to their government: “The circumstances of the world are continually changing, and the opinions of men change also; and as government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it” (lines 73-76). Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not identify the main purpose of both passages.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
42,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The author explains that a “powerful volcano” erupted around 750 years ago and caused “a centuries-long cold snap known as the Little Ice Age” (lines 1-3). The author then states that a group of scientists believe the volcano Samalas was this “powerful volcano,” and she explains how the scientists’ research supports this claim (lines 17-78). Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not identify the main purpose of the passage.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
43,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The author begins the passage by explaining how the Little Ice Age was a “centuries-long cold snap” that was likely caused by a volcanic eruption (lines 1-3). The author then explains how scientists used radiocarbon analysis to determine when the Little Ice Age began and how a volcanic eruption triggered the cooling temperatures (lines 17-25). Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage does not criticize a scientific model, offer a new method of measuring sulfates, or shift from the use of radiocarbon dating to an examination of volcanic glass.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
44,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 17-25, the passage shifts focus from describing a recorded event to providing evidence that the Little Ice Age was likely caused by a volcanic eruption. The passage states that scientists used “radiocarbon dating of dead plant material from beneath the ice caps on Baffin Island and Iceland, as well as ice and sediment core data” to determine when the Little Ice Age began and how it was connected to the “mystery” volcanic eruption. 13 Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not provide the best evidence that the passage shifts focus from a description of a recorded event to its likely cause. Choices B, C, and D all focus on the scientists’ research but do not explain what caused the Little Ice Age.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
45,D,"Choice D is the best answer. According to lines 5-8, “That a powerful volcano erupted somewhere in the world, sometime in the Middle Ages, is written in polar ice cores in the form of layers of sulfate deposits and tiny shards of volcanic glass.” The phrase “is written in” reinforces the idea that the polar ice caps contain evidence of the volcanic eruption, and that scientists can interpret this evidence by examining the “sulfate deposits and tiny shards of volcanic glass.” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the author does not use the phrase “is written in” to demonstrate the concept of the hands-on nature of the scientists’ work, highlight the fact that scientists often write about their work, or underscore the sense of importance scientists have about their work.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
46,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The scientists believe the volcano Samalas, located in Indonesia, was most likely the medieval volcanic eruption (lines 33-35). The eruption likely occurred near the equator because an equatorial location is “consistent with the apparent climate impacts” the scientists observed (lines 61-67). Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the scientists do not suggest that the medieval volcanic eruption was located in the Arctic region, the Antarctic region, or Ecuador.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
47,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 61-64, the author cites geochemist Gifford Miller’s findings that provide evidence that the medieval volcanic eruption most likely occurred in Indonesia near the equator: “It’s not a total surprise that an Indonesian volcano might be the source of the eruption, Miller says. ‘An equatorial eruption is more consistent with the apparent climate impacts.’” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not provide evidence that the medieval volcanic eruption most likely occurred in Indonesia near the equator. Rather, choices A, B, and C focus on the medieval volcano’s power, impact, and magnitude.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
48,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 68-71, the author states, “Another possible candidate—both in terms of timing and geographical location—is Ecuador’s 14 Quilotoa, estimated to have last erupted between 1147 and 1320 C.E.” The phrase “another possible candidate” implies that the scientists believe that in the Middle Ages a different volcanic eruption, such as an eruption from the volcano Quilotoa, could have been responsible for the onset of the Little Ice Age. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the phrase “another possible candidate” does not imply the frequency or effects of volcanic eruptions, or that some volcanoes have large calderas.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
49,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 71-75, the author explains how Lavigne’s team proved that Quilotoa’s eruption did not cause the Little Ice Age: “But when Lavigne’s team examined shards of volcanic glass from this volcano, they found that they didn’t match the chemical composition of the glass found in polar ice cores, whereas the Samalas glass is a much closer match.” These findings show that Samalas, not Quilotoa, was responsible for the onset of the Little Ice Age. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they focus on the difficulty of identifying the volcano responsible for the Little Ice Age, the magnitude of the volcanic eruption, and the researchers’ experiment.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
50,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The data in the figure show the greatest belowaverage temperature variation occurred in 1675 CE, as the temperature reached a variation of −1.0° Celsius. Choice A is incorrect because the figure shows that the temperature in 1200 CE was above average (+0.25° Celsius). Choices B and D are incorrect because the below-average temperature variation reported in 1675 CE (at −1.0° Celsius) was greater than the below-average temperature variation reported for 1375 CE (around −0.25° Celsius) and 1750 CE (around (−0.5° Celsius).",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
51,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The passage says that the Little Ice Age began “about 750 years ago” (line 1) and that “the cold summers and ice growth began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 C.E.” (lines 23-24). The figure indicates that average temperatures in central England began to drop around 1275 CE, and this drop in temperatures continued “through the 1700s” (line 32).
