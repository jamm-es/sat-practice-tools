1,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Throughout the passage, the narrator describes a visit to her family’s ink shop. The narrator’s father and uncles are employed at the shop, and in the third and fifth paragraphs the narrator describes her father’s interactions with a customer. Her father praises the color, sound, and smell of an ink sample as indicators of the ink’s quality. This interaction leads the narrator to conclude in the last paragraph, “I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family’s ink this way.” Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character’s visit to her family’s ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family’s work. Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator’s arrival at her family’s ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie’s beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought. The narrator’s thoughts on Precious Auntie occur in the fourth paragraph, so choice A isn’t the best summary of the overall passage. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage describes the narrator’s surprise visit to the ink shop and a reunion with her uncles, these events occur in the first paragraph. Therefore, choice B doesn’t provide the best summary of the passage as a whole. Choice C is incorrect because the narrator doesn’t make any reference to her father’s ambitions.",false,reading,mcq,
2,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph, the narrator
recounts her Precious Auntie’s belief that “you can never be an artist
if your work comes without effort.” Her Precious Auntie states that
when the physical act of writing is done with an “inkstick along an
inkstone,” this process requires an artist to “take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yours elf,
What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?”
In the following paragraphs, the narrator recalls the pride she felt
while listening to her father describe the high quality of the ink that
her family had worked hard to produce. Therefore, a main theme of the
passage is that quality is achieved through deliberate efiort.

Choice A is incorrect. Although family relationships form a backdrop
to the passage, the nurturing of these relationships isn’t a main theme.
Choice C is incorrect. Although the passage does emphasize that hard
work produces higher quality writing than that which is produced
through minimal work, the passage doesn’t mention that hard work
results in material compensation. Choice D is incorrect. Although

the passage discusses the role of concentrated effort in creative
expression, a main theme of the passage isn’t that creativity needs to
be expressed concretely.",false,reading,mcq,
3,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the first sentence of the second paragraph, the narrator states: “I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen.” She then proceeds to describe the floors of the family’s ink shop, the walls and display cases, and the various items for sale. According to the third paragraph, these include an inkstick “with a top shaped like a fairy boat,” another inkstick with “a bird shape,” and a collection of ink cakes “embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo.” Therefore, throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings. Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator describes herself as shy, the people she interacts with aren’t unfamiliar to her because they are members of her family whom she has met before. Choices C and D are incorrect because the narrator isn’t portrayed as sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C) or anxious about her responsibilities (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
4,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator’s family’s ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, “Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.” Old Widow Lau’s rejection of the uncles’ offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn’t actually want to leave the shop: “She made weak efforts to leave.” Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn’t until the uncles’ “fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat.” Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau’s reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn’t genuinely firm in her resolve. Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn’t imply that Old Widow Lau’s reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice C is incorrect because the shop isn’t unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn’t state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
5,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The previous question asks what can be most reasonably inferred from the passage about Old Widow Lau’s reluctance to stay for tea. The answer, that her reluctance is feigned because she isn’t genuinely firm in her resolve, is best supported by the tenth and eleventh sentences of the first paragraph: “Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t support the answer to the previous question. Instead, they describe the narrator and Old Widow Lau’s arrival at the shop (choice A), their initial reception by the uncles (choice B), and the hospitality the uncles lavish on them once they are seated (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
6,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In the second paragraph, the narrator describes the “shiny” glass display cases at her family’s ink shop and how the silk-wrapped boxes of ink inside these cases “looked so much nicer [in the shop] than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.” Therefore, the narrator indicates that the contrast between the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village and her family’s ink shop is that the ink shop displays the family’s ink more impressively. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the narrator doesn’t state or imply that her family’s ink shop, in comparison to the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village, is more conveniently located for the public (choice B), provides greater individual attention to customers (choice C), or offers a larger space for presenting products (choice D)",false,reading,mcq,
7,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph, the narrator summarizes Precious Auntie’s artistic philosophy: when you write without effort, “you do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn.” In other words, anything written too quickly, and therefore without concerted effort and thought, would be synonymous with the debris floating on top of a pool of water. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Precious Auntie would consider a hastily written first draft of a story to be essentially worthless in and of itself. Choice A is incorrect because Precious Auntie’s description of work made without effort is exclusively negative; therefore, it isn’t reasonable to infer that she would praise a hastily written story draft as emotionally raw and powerful. Choice B is incorrect because Precious Auntie’s artistic philosophy is concerned solely with the quality of the artist’s output rather than with the satisfaction the artist experiences. Choice D is incorrect because whether a hastily produced work would be inappropriately analytical isn’t discussed in the passage.",false,reading,mcq,
8,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The previous question asks what can be reasonably inferred about Precious Auntie’s view of a hastily written first draft of a story, based on the artistic philosophy expressed in the fourth paragraph. The answer, that she would consider such a story to be essentially worthless in and of itself, is best supported by the sixth and seventh sentences of the fourth paragraph, which describe Precious Auntie’s view of writing produced without effort: “You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t support the answer to the previous question. Instead, they transition between the scene in the ink shop and the narrator’s memories of Precious Auntie (choice A), summarize Precious Auntie’s assessment of ink quality (choice B), and describe the process of creating good writing through concerted effort (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
9,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the last sentences of the fourth paragraph, the narrator describes Precious Auntie’s artistic philosophy, or, more specifically, the questions that an artist is forced to ask when working with concerted effort: “You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?” With the second question, Precious Auntie highlights how an artist must strive to create work that resembles, or corresponds with, what is in both the artist’s heart and mind. Therefore, the word “matches,” as used in this sentence, most nearly means corresponds with. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of the passage, “matches” means corresponds with, not competes against (choice A), runs counter to (choice C), or treats equally (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
10,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In the fifth paragraph, the narrator’s father demonstrates the quality of an inkstick to a customer. He strikes the inkstick, and the narrator describes “a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell.” Therefore, the word “clean,” as used in this paragraph to describe a sound that the inkstick produced, most nearly means distinct, or clear. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in the context of the passage, “clean” means distinct, not complete (choice A), skillful (choice B), or upright (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT

12,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The fifth paragraph details the results of the fourth experiment of Wegner’s study, where participants were more likely to recall digital folder locations where statements they typed were saved than the actual statements themselves. The first sentence of the last paragraph summarizes why this result may not be alarming: “And even though we may not be taxing our memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using them to consider where the facts are located and how to access them.” In this sentence, the author paraphrases Wegner’s view that although human memory is changing as a result of technology, this doesn’t indicate that human memory is declining, as people are relying on their memory to access specific types of information. Therefore, this sentence best supports the idea that reliance on computers doesn’t necessarily diminish human memory. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the cited lines don’t support the idea that reliance on computers doesn’t necessarily diminish human memory. Instead, they introduce the topic of Wegner’s research (choice A), provide examples of the types of information that people may now rely on the Internet to provide (choice B), and concede that the Internet may diminish critical thinking skills (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
13,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In the third paragraph, the author

outlines Wagner’s theory of a “transactive memory source.” According

to Wegner, transactive memory is a “network of memory,” where an

individual can access information that he or she can’t personally

recall from a particular source. The author illustrates this idea in the
second sentence of this paragraph, with the example of “a husband
[who] relies on his wife to remember a relative’s birthday.” Thus,
the reference to remembering a relative’s birthday mainly serves
to illustrate the concept of a transactive memory source using a
familiar situation.
Choice A is incorrect. Although the situation of a husband relying on
his wife’s memory does suggest that closely related people tend to
have shared memories, this isn’t the main purpose of this reference in
the context of the passage. Choice B is incorrect because the example
doesn’t demonstrate how people initially developed external sources
of memory. Choice C is incorrect because the function of the example
isn’t to emphasize the effectiveness and accuracy of transactive
memory sources. Instead, its function is to make the abstract concept
of transactive memory more easily understandable.",false,reading,mcq,
14,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the third paragraph, Wagner describes
transactive memory as a “network of memory where you don’t have
to remember everything in the world yourself.” Instead, the burden
of storing information is shifted to transactive memory sources
that can function as “extensions of [human] memory.” Examples of
sources provided in the fourth paragraph of the passage include cell
phones, GPS devices, and search engines. What these examples have
in common is that they store information, such as phone numbers,
directions, and general knowledge, so that a person doesn’t have
to commit this information to memory. A written list of a user’s
passwords for different websites serves the same function as these
examples. Although remembering a list of passwords for different
websites is conceivable without a list, keeping such a list shifts
the burden of storing readily memorable information away from the
user because the list preserves the information in place of the user’s
memory. Therefore, based on the passage, a written list of a user’s
passwords for different websites would be considered a transactive
memory source.
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they don’t accurately
exemplify transactive memory sources. A souvenir brought home from
a memorable trip (choice A) may evoke memories of that place for the
owner. However, it doesn’t preserve actual information in the way the
examples provided in the passage do. A library database that helps
users locate specific books (choice C) may seem similar to a search
engine. However, it doesn’t store information that would otherwise
be readily memorable in the way that a search engine can help a user
remember an actor’s name or a detail of geography, according to the
fourth paragraph of the passage. Instead, it helps a library patron
navigate a system that is typically far too vast to be committed to
memory. A website that helps users plan and make travel arrangements
(choice D) may help facilitate transactions in the form of ticket

purchases or hotel reservations. However, it doesn‘t store information

that the user would otherwise memorize.",false,reading,mcq,
15,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the last sentence of the third paragraph, the author states that “computers and technology . . . are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.” In other words, computers and technology are becoming memory sources that serve as additions to human memory. Thus, “extensions of,” as used in the passage, most nearly means additions to. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of the passage, “extensions of” means additions to, not delays in (choice A), lengths of (choice C), or developments of (choice D)",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
16,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The fifth paragraph of the passage describes four experiments that Wegner conducted to demonstrate his theory of a transactional memory source. The first experiment, described in the second sentence of this paragraph, found that participants “were more likely to think of computer terms like ‘Yahoo’ or ‘Google’ after being asked a set of difficult trivia questions.” The second, third, and fourth experiments explored participants’ tendency to remember the location of information rather than the information itself. Therefore, the discussion of the experiments, most specifically the first experiment, suggests that people are inclined to think of specific information sources in response to being asked to provide facts that aren’t already familiar to them. Choice A is incorrect. Although some of the subjects in the second experiment did memorize information that later became inaccessible, this act of memorization didn’t cause the subjects to think of specific information sources. Choice B is incorrect. Although participants in the fourth experiment were told their work would be saved in specific folders, they weren’t directed to develop a system for organizing and saving content. Choice D is incorrect because none of the experiments involved participants being prompted to identify terms related to dependence on computers.",false,reading,mcq,
17,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The previous question asks, based on
Wegner’s experiments, when people would be inclined to think of
specific information sources. The answer, that being asked to provide
facts that aren’t already familiar to them provokes this response, is
best supported by the second sentence of the fifth paragraph: “In the
first experiment, participants demonstrated that they were more likely
to think of computer terms like ‘Yahoo’ or ‘Google’ after being asked a
set of difficult trivia questions.”

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t
support the answer to the previous question. Instead, they describe
the different parameters for the participants in the second and
third experiments (choice B), summarize the results of the second
and third experiments (choice C), and summarize the results of the
fourth experiment (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
18,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The second sentence of the sixth paragraph states: “Students who have trouble remembering distinct facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts in critical thinking.” In other words, students who find it difficult to remember information may find it challenging to utilize that information to develop logical arguments. Therefore, the word “employ,” as used in the context of this sentence, most nearly means utilize. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of the passage, “employ” means utilize, not enroll (choice B), exert (choice C), or assign (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
19,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The passage explains that in the fourth experiment participants were given statements and folder locations where they were told those statements would be saved. On the graph, the bar farthest to the left represents those who remembered both elements of the information given to them during the experiment. This bar rises to a point midway between 15% and 20%. Therefore, according to the graph, approximately 17% of participants remembered both parts of the information given to them during the fourth experiment. Choice A is incorrect because none of the groups represented on the graph comprised 7% of participants. Choices B and D are incorrect because neither 10% (choice B) nor 30% (choice D) of participants remembered both elements of the information given to them during the fourth experiment. Instead, 10% remembered statements but not folder locations (according to the second bar from the left), while 30% remembered folder locations but not statements (according to the third bar from the left).",false,reading,mcq,
20,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The largest single group of participants
represented on the graph is composed of those who remembered
nothing, as indicated by the bar that is farthest to the right. Why
approximately 40% of participants could not remember the statements
or the folder locations isn’t explained by the description of the
fourth experiment in the fifth paragraph of the passage. Therefore, the
most likely explanation for the findings regarding the largest single
group of participants represented on the graph is that there isn’t enough
information to determine the cause of the results for those participants.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because these speculations aren’t
supported by the passage. There isn’t enough information provided
about the fourth experiment to know whether the participants who
could remember nothing focused on remembering the folder locations
(choice A), attempted to remember the statements and the folder
locations (choice B), or didn’t attempt to remember any specific pieces
of information (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
21,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Throughout the passage, the author describes experiments conducted on guppies to determine the guppies’ rate of and types of evolutionary change. The first paragraph outlines the reason why these fish were an optimal choice for this research: their “unstinting rate of reproduction makes guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of evolution.” Therefore, the first paragraph mainly serves to establish the reason why a certain species was selected for scientific observation. Choice B is incorrect because the purpose of the first paragraph isn’t to illustrate the value of studying the offspring of a particular animal shortly after birth. Instead, guppies were selected because of their rapid rate of reproduction and weren’t only studied shortly after being born, according to the passage. Choices C and D are incorrect. Although the fourth paragraph does introduce a new method of scientific inquiry (experimental evolution), the first paragraph doesn’t mainly serve to introduce a theory at the center of an ongoing scientific debate (choice C) or offer a rationale for the prevalence of a new field of scientific inquiry (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,
22,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The third sentence of the

second paragraph states, “A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or

a set of rapids, which keep out the predatory fish called pike cichlids

found in calmer downstream waters.” In other words, pike cichlids

normally eat guppies, but waterfalls and rapids can create natural

barriers that prevent these predators from entering certain areas where

guppies live. Thus, in describing the living conditions of guppies,

the author indicates that a “lucky guppy” is one that inhabits an

environment that provides natural protection from predators.

Choices A and C are incorrect because the author doesn’t indicate that

being born in a major river with an established guppy population is

an advantage for a guppy (choice A) or that there are risks associated

with living near a waterfall or that guppies benefit by avoiding such

risks (choice C). Choice D is incorrect because the author doesn’t

indicate that there is an advantage for guppies living in calmer


downstream waters. Instead, the author notes that calmer downstream
waters are where guppies’ predators live, making these zones more
dangerous for guppies than the areas above waterfalls or rapids.",false,reading,mcq,
23,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In the last paragraph, the author describes an experiment in which Reznick’s team removed groups of guppies from areas with large populations of pike cichlid predators and relocated them into areas above waterfalls and rapids. According to the second sentence of this paragraph, “Although small predatory killifish occurred in these new sites, these fish do not pose anything close to the danger of the cichlids.” This sentence provides the best evidence for the conclusion that the streams used by Reznick’s team were not entirely free of predators, as they contained populations of killifish. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the cited lines don’t provide the best evidence for the conclusion that the streams used by Reznick’s team were not entirely free of predators. Instead, they explain the advantage for guppies living above waterfalls or rapids (choice A), outline the correlation between numbers of pike cichlids and guppy mortality rates (choice B), and explain the growing popularity of “experimental evolution” among scientists (choice C).",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
24,A,"Choice A is the best answer. According to the fourth paragraph, the existence of streams in Trinidad with populations of guppies and those without guppies led Reznick to the conclusion that he could conduct experiments by altering the guppy populations in various streams. According to the second sentence of the fourth paragraph, Reznick realized he could “‘treat streams like giant test tubes by introducing guppies or predators’ to places they had not originally occurred, and then watch as natural selection acted on the guppies.” Reznick uses the phrase “giant test tubes” in this sentence to suggest that certain streams can provide suitable experimental conditions for his guppy research. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the phrase “giant test tubes” serves to characterize certain streams as suitable for experimental research, not to suggest that those streams promote cooperative behaviors among guppies used as subjects in experimental studies (choice B), increase the rate of genetic change among guppies (choice C), or assist scientists in solving environmental problems in the natural habitat of guppies (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
25,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The fourth paragraph describes Reznick's
rationale for moving populations of guppies from one body of water
to another. The last sentence of the paragraph states, “This kind of
real-world manipulation of nature is called ‘experimental evolution,’

and it is growing increasingly popular among scientists working with
organisms that reproduce quickly enough for humans to be able to see
the outcome within our lifetimes.” In other words, the fact that this
type of research is “growing increasingly popular” means that it is
becoming more widespread. Thus, the word “popular” as used in the
passage most nearly means widespread.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in the context of the
passage, “popular” means widespread, not accessible (choice A),
suitable (choice B), or likable (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
26,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Reznick’s team found that guppies, when moved from predator-ridden environments to a site where there was not the same level of predation, “evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that naturally occurred in the cichlid-free streams,” according to the fourth sentence of the last paragraph. If it were discovered that the new site into which Reznick released the guppies were inhabited by fish found to be as predatory as the cichlids in the original sites, this discovery would undermine Reznick’s findings. Such a finding would mean that the pressure of predation on the guppies remained constant from one site to the next. As a consequence, some other factor or factors would be responsible for the developmental changes in the guppies that Reznick’s team recorded. Choice A is incorrect. If guppies examined in other parts of the globe were found to exhibit genetic shifts in traits at a different rate from the guppies Reznick examined, these findings would not undermine his research because they would have occurred outside the confines of his experimental conditions. Choice C is incorrect. If experimental evolution were shown to be harmful to the environment, this finding, though important, would not undermine Reznick’s findings. Choice D is incorrect. If the descendants of Reznick’s transplanted fish were proven to mature later than the guppies living below the waterfall, this finding would support, rather than undermine, Reznick’s findings.",false,reading,mcq,
27,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The last sentence of the passage states,
“Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown evolutionary change
in as few as two and a half years, or a little over four generations, with
more time required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability to form
schools and less time for changes in the colorful spots and stripes on
a male’s body.” That is, certain traits, such as physical markings, seem
to change more quickly than other traits, such as aspects of group
behavior. Thus, it can most reasonably be inferred from the passage
that the experiments in Trinidad have shown that some genetic traits
will evolve more readily than others.
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the experiments in Trinidad
led to conclusions about guppies’ rate of evolutionary changes. These
experiments did not lead to an identification of other dangerous
predators (choice B), an analysis of how certain guppies thrive better
in predator-ridden environments (choice C), or an examination as to
how evolutionary changes can be prevented in a natural environment

29,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The number of offspring produced by guppies living in the south slope high-predation environment is indicated by the first bar from the left in figure 1. This bar rises to a point midway between 6 and 7 on the graph. Therefore, according to figure 1, guppies living in the south slope high-predation environment produced a mean number of offspring between 6 and 7. Choice A is incorrect because 2 to 3 offspring were produced by guppies living in the south slope low-predation environment, rather than those living in the high-predation environment, as indicated by the second bar from the left in figure 1. Choice B is incorrect because 3 to 4 offspring were produced by guppies living in the north slope lowpredation environment, rather than guppies living in the south slope high-predation environment, as indicated by the bar that is farthest to the right in figure 1. Choice C is incorrect because none of the groups represented in figure 1 produced 5 to 6 offspring.",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
30,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The graph shows that the mean
embryo mass in a low-predation enviromnent for south slope guppies
(second bar from the left) is higher than mean embryo mass in a

high-predation environment for south slope guppies (bar farthest to the
left). A similar relationship exists for north slope guppies, as the mean
embryo mass in a low-predation environment (bar farthest to the right)
is higher than the mean embryo mass in a high-predation environment
(third bar from the left). Meanwhile, a comparison of south slope high-
predation environments (bar farthest to the left) to north slope high-
predation environments shows no difference in mean embryo mass.
The graph shows that while there is a slightly lower mean embryo
mass in north slope low-predation environments (bar farthest to the
right) than in south slope low-predation environments (second bar from
the left), this difference is only 0.2 mg, which is considerably less than
the difference that results from comparing the low- and high-predation
environments in each of the two locations. Therefore, the conclusion
about the mean mass of guppy embryos that is best supported by
figure 2 is that the predation level observed in each environment had
more of an effect on mean embryo mass than did slope location.
Choice A is incorrect because slope location wasn’t a better indicator
of mean embryo mass than was the predation level observed in each
environment. Instead, the mean masses of embryos in the two locations
were roughly equivalent. Choice B is incorrect because the mean
embryo mass of guppies born in the north slope environments didn’t
exceed the mean embryo mass of guppies born in the south slope
environments. Guppies living in high-predation environments in both
north and south slope locations had embryos with the same mass,
while those living on the north slope in low-predation environments
had embryos with a slightly lower mass than that of south slope
guppies in low-predation environments. Therefore, the mean embryo
mass of guppies born in the south slope environment exceeded the
mean embryo mass of guppies born in the north slope environment.
Choice D is incorrect because guppies born in low-predation
environments didn’t have a mean embryo mass less than that of
guppies born in high-predation environments. Instead, these guppies
had a greater mass.",false,reading,mcq,
31,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Figure 1 shows that guppies from low-
predation environments (represented on the graph by second and
fourth bars from the left) had smaller litters, or fewer guppy offspring,
than did guppies from high-predation environments (represented by the
first and third bars from the left). Similarly, figure 2 shows that guppies
from low-predation environments (the second and fourth bars from the
left) also had embryos with a greater mean mass than did guppies from
high-predation environments (the first and third bars from the left).
Choice A is incorrect. Although figure 1 does support the conclusion
that guppies from low-predation environments have fewer offspring
than those from high-predation environments, neither figure indicates
the time required for guppies to reach full maturity. Choice C is
incorrect because neither figure indicates the survival rate of guppies,

and figure 2 directly contradicts the conclusion that guppies from low-
predation environments have less mean embryo mass than those from
high-predation environments. Choice D is incorrect. Although figure 2
supports the conclusion that guppies from low-predation environments
have a greater mean embryo mass than those from high-predation

In the second sentence of the first paragraph, Smith states that confronting slavery is “a question of justice” and that it involves “considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of our country.” In the third paragraph, Smith argues that women shouldn’t be deterred from participating in the abolitionist cause. In the last paragraph, she argues that women “cannot remain inactive” in confronting slavery as “our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman. . . . Let our course, then, still be onward!” Therefore, Smith’s main purpose in the passage is to encourage women to see their participation in the abolitionist cause as just and important. Choices A and C are incorrect because Smith doesn’t accuse fellow abolitionists of overlooking the contributions that women have made to the movement (choice A) or make the case that women’s rights are meaningless while slavery exists (choice C). Choice B is incorrect.

33,B,"Choice A is the best answer. Throughout the passage, Smith poses
questions that aren’t answered explicitly until the last paragraph, but
the leading tone of the speech makes it clear that the implied answer
to these questions is “no.” In the second paragraph, Smith questions
her critics’ claim that upholding humanitarian values undermines
conventional feminine virtues. In the third paragraph, she wonders
how women can “have no interest” in the subject of slavery when it
could lead to the destruction of their families through war. In the last
paragraph, she asks women numerous questions and then answers
them with a “no.” Thus, a technique that Smith uses throughout the
passage to advance her main point is to present her claims in the form
of rhetorical questions that mostly have implicit negative answers.
Choice B is incorrect. Although Smith questions the assertions that
her opponents made, she doesn’t criticize her opponents themselves
by quoting self-contradictory remarks they have made. Choice C


is incorrect. Although Smith makes use of vivid language and imagery

throughout the passage, she doesn’t illustrate each of her central

ideas with an emotionally powerful anecdote. Choice D is incorrect.

34,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the first sentence of the passage, Smith introduces the argument that slavery is a “political question” and therefore not “within the ‘province of woman.’” In the second sentence, Smith voices her opposition to this argument: “It is not true that [slavery] is merely a political question, it is likewise a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion.” In other words, slavery is too broad a problem to be classified solely as “political,” in Smith’s view. However, in the fourth paragraph, Smith returns to the political aspect of the argument at hand by addressing how women must engage in the subject of slavery on a political scale. She argues that “admitting [slavery] to be a political question” doesn’t mean that women have “no interest in the welfare of our country,” as women must criticize slavery and its “unjust laws” and seek to stop the nation’s “downward course” by choosing to not “remain inactive.” Therefore, Smith develops her argument about slavery as a “political question” over the course of the passage by dismissing the designation as too narrow but then demonstrates its relevance to her audience. Choice A is incorrect. Although Smith does offer alternative ways of defining the problem of slavery, she doesn’t claim that the designation of slavery as a “political question” is outdated, but rather that it is insufficient. Choice C is incorrect because Smith doesn’t contend that the designation of slavery as a “political question” has become trite, nor does she invite her audience to revitalize it. Choice D is incorrect. Although Smith’s argument is intertwined with questions of gender roles, she doesn’t describe the meaning the designation of a “political question” has for men and then challenge women to embrace it.",false,reading,mcq,
35,A,"Choice B is the best answer. In the first sentence of the passage,

Smith relays a claim: “We are told that it is not within the ‘province

of woman,’ to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a ‘political

question,’ and we are ’stepping out of our sphere,’ when we take part

in its discussion.” In the next sentence, Smith rejects this claim: “It is

not true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise a question

of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion.” She then argues that

the subject of slavery “involves considerations of immense importance

to the welfare and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the

home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of our fellow

beings” and expands upon this point by providing an example of the

difference, under slavery, between laborers who are enslaved and those

who are within the “dignity of conscious manhood.” Therefore, the
best summary of the first paragraph is that Smith rejects a claim and
elaborates on her reasons for doing so.
Choice A is incorrect. Although Smith may outline a conventional
viewpoint in the first paragraph, she doesn’t present evidence
to support it. Choice C is incorrect. Although Smith introduces
her subject in the first paragraph, she doesn’t provide historical

In the first sentence of the second paragraph, Smith relays the sentiment, presumably voiced by those opposed to women abolitionists, that “woman ‘can take no part [in the debate over slavery] without losing something of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments.’” Smith opposes this view in the following sentence: “must woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is open to the claims of humanity, or less modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their rescue?” The leading tone of this rhetorical question makes it clear that Smith would answer it with a “no.” Thus, Smith argues that it is possible for women to act according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Smith doesn’t argue that it is possible for women to adhere to personal morality while being politically neutral (choice B), contribute to their family’s financial security while meeting social expectations (choice C), or resist calls for war while still opposing slavery (choice D).",false,reading,mcq,

less gentle because her heart is open to the claims of humanity, or
less modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved

The first paragraph of Passage 1 presents a quote by biochemist Kim Lewis of Northeastern University: “Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis.” The rest of the passage describes Lewis’s research and the experimental antibiotic called teixobactin that her research has produced. According to the second paragraph of the passage, teixobactin has “proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that have developed immunity to other drugs.” Therefore, the first paragraph of Passage 1 primarily serves to identify a problem that the research discussed in the passage may help to address. Choice A is incorrect because although the first paragraph quotes a claim by Lewis regarding antibiotic resistance, this claim isn’t developed over the course of Passage 1. Choice B is incorrect because the claim made in the first paragraph regarding antibiotic resistance isn’t presented as controversial, nor does Passage 1 attempt to resolve any scientific controversies.

describes how, historically, the development of antibiotics requires

“natural microbial substances,” but this reliance has severe limitations

as only about one percent of these microbial substances can be

grown in a laboratory. The author goes on to explain how “the rest,

in staggering numbers, have remained uncultured and of limited use

to medical science, until now.” The paragraph then describes the

method Lewis’s team used to grow teixobactin microorganisms “in

their natural environment where they already have the conditions they

need for growth.” Therefore, the author of Passage 1 suggests that an

advantage of the method Lewis’s team used to grow microorganisms

is that it allows researchers to make use of soil bacteria that they had

previously been unable to exploit.

Choice A is incorrect because although the author of Passage 1

suggests that Lewis’s team identified the requirements for soil bacteria

to thrive, the team didn’t replicate those features in artificial soil.

Instead, the author suggests in the third and fourth paragraphs of

Passage 1 that they used real soil samples. Choice B is incorrect

because the author of Passage 1 doesn’t suggest that the method

Lewis’s team used to grow microorganisms enabled soil bacteria to

take in more nutrients than they typically consume in natural settings.
Instead, it can be inferred from the fourth paragraph of the passage
that the bacteria were provided with the same nutrients they consume

But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have remained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now.” Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the cited lines don’t support the answer to the previous question.

led to the development of teixobactin employed growing bacteria from
soil. The author concludes in the last sentence of the first paragraph that
Lewis's team’s “simple and elegant methodology . . . opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-producing bacteria.”
Therefore, the author of Passage 2 would most likely agree with the
statement that the development of teixobactin confirms a long-held belief
about a potential source of new antibiotics.
Choice A is incorrect because the author of Passage 2 wouldn’t likely
agree with the statement that the development of teixobactin reveals
that some antibiotics are effective against gram-negative bacteria.
The author mentions gram-negative bacteria in the third paragraph to
highlight teixobactin’s inefiectiveness in combating it, not to discuss
other antibiotics that are efiective against gram-negative bacteria.
Choice B is incorrect because the author wouldn’t likely agree with the
statement that the development of teixobactin shows that conventional
methods can still yield new types of antibiotics. Instead, the author

contends that the unconventional method used to produce teixobactin

that the methodology Lewis and others developed “is their most
important finding . . . for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of

This choice is the most effective because it doesn’t repeat the word “people.” Furthermore, this choice’s use of the active voice, which indicates that “more people” (the subject of the sentence) use public transportation, eliminates unnecessary wording. Choices A and C are incorrect because they unnecessarily repeat the noun “people.” Choice D is incorrect because the use of the passive voice, which changes the subject of the sentence from “more people” to “using public transportation,” creates a wordy sentence.",false,writing,mcq,"WORDS_IN_CONTEXT,

14,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The colon correctly introduces information that illustrates what has come before it. The independent clause that follows the colon indicates that “car traffic in Tallinn was down less than 3 percent,” which supports the statement before the colon that “car use in Tallinn has only slightly declined.” Choice A is incorrect because the semicolon awkwardly joins an independent clause with the dependent clause that follows. Choice C is incorrect because it creates a comma splice. Choice D is incorrect because it creates a sentence fragment after the period.",false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
15,D,"Choice D is the best answer. “The policy” clearly indicates what was enacted. The passage indicates that “car traffic in Tallinn was down less than 3 percent” since the policy of fare-free rides was enacted.

16,A,"Choice A is the best answer. This choice best introduces the paragraph; the phrase “devastating effect” sets up the paragraph’s discussion of how fare-free systems can negatively impact a city’s transportation budget. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they don’t introduce the paragraph’s topic, which is the devastating effects of a fare-free system on a city’s budget. The paragraph doesn’t focus on changes in service, negative environmental impact, or increased crowding on public transportation.",false,writing,mcq,EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS
17,C,Choice C is the best answer. The comma after “savings” and the conjunction “but” are used correctly to connect the two independent clauses. Choices A and B are incorrect because they each create a comma splice.

18,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The expression “overly optimistic” is consistent with the formal tone of the passage. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect.

19,C,"Choice C is the best answer. This choice provides an accurate interpretation because the chart indicates that the projected total additional operating costs for implementing a fare-free policy in San Francisco, CA, would be $184 million per year. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they don’t accurately interpret the information provided in the chart for San Francisco, CA. The chart projects a cost of $112 million in lost fares, not a deficit of $72 million per year in lost fares (choice A) or a savings of $112 million from lost fares (choice B).

20,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The sentence shouldn’t be added because the fact that Eugene, OR, “would lose only $5 million” doesn’t support the writer’s argument that fare-free systems cause large financial losses to governments. Choices A and B are incorrect. The sentence shouldn’t be added because the fact that Eugene, OR, would lose only $5 million in fares doesn’t support the writer’s argument against fare-free systems. Furthermore, it doesn’t reinforce any claim made earlier in the paragraph by advocates of fare-free policies.

21,B,Choice B is the best answer. The present indicative verb “do [not] have” is consistent in tense and mood with the present indicative verb “can go” earlier in the sentence.

22,D,"Choice D is the best answer. This choice provides the best conclusion to the passage, which argues that fare-free transportation policies “have not been found to be an effective way to address traffic problems” and “may result in serious budget shortfalls.” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they don’t provide the best conclusion to the passage.

23,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The singular third person pronoun “it” correctly refers to the singular antecedent “digital camera.” Choice A is incorrect because the plural pronoun “they” doesn’t agree in number with the singular antecedent “digital camera.” (It wouldn't make sense here to assume that “they” refers to “professional photographers,” as there’s no clear indication that the photographers referred to used the earliest digital cameras.)

24,B,"Choice B is the best answer. To make the paragraph most logical, the new sentence “Why wouldn’t they?” should be placed after sentence 2.

Furthermore, the two sentences that follow the new sentence answer the question of why photographers would trade film for digital cameras by stating that the latest digital cameras take pictures that are “crisp,” “bright,” and “sharp.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because placing the new sentence anywhere in the paragraph other than after sentence 2 would create an illogical and confusing paragraph.",false,writing,mcq,EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS
25,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The new sentence should be added because its reference to “several intricate steps” sets up the process of wet plate photography discussed in the rest of the paragraph. Choice A is incorrect.

26,D,Choice D is the best answer. The plural possessive pronoun “their” agrees in number with the plural antecedent “photographers” and correctly indicates that the subjects belong to the photographers. Choice A is incorrect because “it’s” is a contraction for “it is” and doesn’t make sense in the sentence. Choice B is incorrect because “its” is a singular possessive pronoun and doesn’t agree in number with the plural antecedent “photographers.” Choice C is incorrect because “there” isn’t a possessive pronoun.,false,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
27,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The coordinating conjunction “so” is used correctly to indicate that because dried collodion is unusable, a photographer has to work quickly to develop the film once the photo is taken. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they don’t convey the intended cause-and-effect relationship between the two independent clauses. “But” (choice B) indicates that an exception or contrast to what was said previously will follow. “And” (choice C) suggests that the two clauses indicate separate ideas instead of a cause-and-effect relationship. “For” (choice D), used as a conjunction, means “because.” If used in this sentence, “for” would indicate that dried collodion is unusable because the photographer must quickly develop the photograph.",false,writing,mcq,"EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS,

28,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The word “mere” most effectively suggests that the photographer has only a very brief time to develop wet plate photographs.

30,D,"Choice D is the best answer. No punctuation is needed in the sentence except for a period. Choice A is incorrect because the parentheses indicate that the information between them could be deleted without changing the meaning of the sentence. In this sentence, the information in the parentheses contains the direct object of the verb “give” and is essential.

The reference to “nineteenth-century wave riders” accomplishes the writer’s goal of highlighting the contrast between present-day photographer Joni Sternbach’s nineteenth-century techniques and her contemporary subjects. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they don’t highlight a contrast between Sternbach’s techniques and her subjects.
