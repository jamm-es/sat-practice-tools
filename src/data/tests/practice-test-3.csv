1,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the passage, Lady Carlotta is approached by the “imposingly attired lady” Mrs. Quabarl while standing at a train station (lines 32-35). Mrs. Quabarl assumes Lady Carlotta is her new nanny, Miss Hope: “You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come to meet” (lines 36-37). Lady Carlotta does not correct Mrs. Quabarl’s mistake and replies, “Very well, if I must I must” (line 39). Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage is not about a woman weighing a job choice, seeking revenge on an acquaintance, or disliking her new employer.",false,reading,mcq,
2,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 1-3, the narrator states that Lady Carlotta “stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length” in order to “kill time.” In this context, Lady Carlotta was taking a “turn,” or a short walk, along the platform while waiting for the train to leave the station. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in this context “turn” does not mean slight movement, change in rotation, or course correction. While Lady Carlotta may have had to rotate her body while moving across the station, “took a turn” implies that Lady Carlotta took a short walk along the platform’s length.",false,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
3,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 10-14, the narrator slates that some of
Lady Carlotta’s acquaintances would often admonish, or criticize, Lady Carlotta

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the narrator does not suggest that
other people viewed Lady Carlotta as tactful, ambitious, or unfriendly.",false,reading,mcq,
4,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 10-14, the narrator states that people
often criticized Lady Carlotta and suggested that she not interfere in other
people’s affairs, which were “none of her business.” The fact that people
often were critical of Lady Carlotta’s behavior provides evidence that Lady
Carlotta was outspoken.

outspoken. Choices B, C, and D mention Lady Carlotta, but do not specify
how others view her.",false,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
5,C,"Choice C is the best answer. Lines 4-10 establish that Lady Carlotta
intervened on the part of a struggling horse, the ldnd of behavior for
which, lines 10-14 indicate, she received “plentiful admonition” from
“certain of her acquaintances,” who believed that she should mind her
own business. Lines 14-22 indicate that Lady Carlotta had “only once . . .
put the doctrine of non-interference into practice,” and that was when
“one of its most eloquent exponents” had been “besieged for nearly
three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an
angry boar-pig” while Lady Carlotta blithely ignored the other woman’s
hypocritical pleas for interference. This incident provides insight into
Lady Carlotta’s character and also evokes humor through language choice
(e.g., the droll understatement of “it is to be feared that [Lady Carlotta] lost
the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady”; lines 22-23) and the sense
that, narratively speaking, justice has been served.

Choice A is incorrect because nothing about the incident suggests
deception on Lady Carlotta’s part. Choice B is incorrect because

there is nothing subtle about Lady Carlotta leaving another woman
stuck in a tree for nearly three hours. Moreover, the passage does not
suggest that this was an act of cruelty on Lady Carlotta’s part; rather,
the passage suggests that Lady Carlotta was justified in giving the
woman stuck in a tree exactly what the woman had so often asked for:
noninterference. Choice D is incorrect because the passage indicates
that Lady Carlotta was acting consistently with her beliefs and only
invoked the doctrine to teach a hypocritical person a lesson.",false,reading,mcq,
6,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The narrator explains that Mrs. Quabarl
told Lady Carlotta about the “nature of the charge” when she gave Lady
Carlotta details about the Quabarl children (line 53-61). Since Lady
Carlotta is pretending to be a governess, the term “charge” refers to her
responsibilities, or job duties, when caring for the Quabarl children.

7,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Lady Carlotta learns about Mrs. Quabarl’s children Claude, Wilfrid, and Irene (lines 53-58). The narrator then describes Mrs. Quabarl’s child Viola as “something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century” (lines 58-61). This statement about Viola implies that all of the Quabarl children have skills typical, or “of a mould equally commonplace,” to other peers in their social class.

19,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Figure 1 shows that 10.7% of

public transportation passengers are students and 6.7% of public

transportation passengers are retirees. Thus, more students than

retirees use public transportation.

Choices B and C are incorrect because figure 1 shows that more

employed than unemployed people use public transportation and that

more employed people than homemakers use public transportation.


Choice D is incorrect because figure 1 does not explain how frequently

transportation passengers are “employed outside the home,” and figure 2
indicates that 59.1% of public transportation trips are for “work.” It

can be inferred from these figures that many public transportation
passengers take public transportation to their place of employment.

21,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The author explains that Ken Dial
created an experiment to study the evolution of flight by observing
how baby Chukars learn to fly. During the experiment, Dial noticed

the unusual way Chukars use their “‘wings and legs cooperatively’ ”

to scale hay bales (lines 38-43), and he created “a series of ingenious
experiments” (line 46) to study this observation. After his additional
experiments, Dial determined that these baby birds angle “their wings
differently from birds in flight” (lines 49-50).

25,C,"Choice C is the best answer. When a rancher observed Dial’s
laboratory setup, he was “incredulous” that the Chukars were living on
the ground, and he advised Dial to give the birds “something to climb
on” (lines 16-23). This “key piece of advice” (line 14) led Dial to add
hay bales to his laboratory. Dial later noticed that the Chukars were
using their legs and wings to scale the hay bales, and this observation
became the focal point of his research.

rancher did not serve to reveal Dial’s motivation for creating the
project, emphasize differences in laboratory and field research, or
introduce a contributor to a scientific theory.",false,reading,mcq,
26,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The author explains that Dial’s “aha
moment” came when he determined the Chukars used “their legs
and wings cooperatively” to scale the hay bales (lines 40-42). Dial
then created additional experiments to study how the birds dealt with
gradually steeper inclines: “[he filmed] the birds as they raced up
textured ramps tilted at increasing angles” (lines 46-48).

not followed by Dial teaching the birds to fly, studying videos to

find out why the birds no longer hopped, or consulting with other
researchers.",false,reading,mcq,
27,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Dial observed that as the Chukars raced
up steep ramps, they “began to flap” and “aimed their flapping down
and backward, using the force . . . to keep their feet firmly pressed
against the ramp” (lines 49-53). Dial determined that the position of
their flapping wings facilitated the baby Chukars’ traction on the steep
ramps.

indicate that the Chukars’ speed, alternation of wing and foot
movement, or continual hopping motions facilitated their traction on
steep ramps.",false,reading,mcq,
