1,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The passage begins with the main character, Lymie, sitting in a restaurant and reading a history book. The first paragraph describes the book in front of him (“Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body,” lines 11- 13). The second paragraph reveals what Lymie is reading about (the Peace of Paris and the Congress of Vienna) and suggests his intense concentration on the book (“sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating,” lines 23-24). In the third paragraph, the focus of the passage shifts to a description and discussion of others in the restaurant, namely “A party of four, two men and two women . . . ” (lines 42-43). Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not provide observations made by other characters, only offering Lymie’s and the narrator’s observations. Choice B is incorrect because the beginning of the passage focuses on Lymie as he reads by himself and the end of the passage focuses on the arrival of Lymie’s father, with whom Lymie’s relationship seems somewhat strained. Choice C is incorrect because the setting is described in the beginning of the first paragraph but is never the main focus of the passage.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
2,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The main purpose of the first paragraph is to establish the passage’s setting by describing a place and an object. The place is the Alcazar Restaurant, which is described as being “long and narrow” and decorated with “art moderne,” murals, and plants (lines 2-6), and the object is the history book Lymie is reading. Choice A is incorrect because rather than establishing what Lymie does every night, the first paragraph describes what Lymie is doing on one night. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the first paragraph indicates when the passage takes place, as the details provided (such as the restaurant and the book) are not specific to one era. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the first paragraph clearly foreshadows a later event.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
3,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The passage states that “when Lymie put down his fork and began to count . . . the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away” (lines 34-38). It is reasonable to assume that Irma thinks Lymie is finished eating because he is no longer holding his fork. Choice A is incorrect because Lymie has already been reading his book while eating for some time before Irma thinks he is finished eating. Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn’t state that Lymie’s plate is empty, and the fact that Lymie stops Irma from taking his plate suggests that it is not empty. Choice D is incorrect because the passage gives no indication that Lymie asks Irma to clear the table.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
4,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The passage makes it clear that Lymie finds the party of four who enter the restaurant to be loud and bothersome, as their entrance means he is no longer able to concentrate on his book: “They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for . . . and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women’s voices . . . which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them” (lines 52-59). Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because lines 55-59 make clear that Lymie is annoyed by the party of four, not that he finds their presence refreshing (choice B), thinks they resemble the people he is reading about (choice C), or thinks they represent glamour and youth (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,
5,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The previous question asks about Lymie’s impression of the party of four who enter the restaurant, with the correct answer being that he finds them noisy and distracting. This is supported in lines 55-59: “But it was the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women’s voices, which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about Lymie’s impression of the party of four who enter the restaurant. Rather than showing that Lymie finds the group of strangers noisy and distracting, the lines simply describe how two of the four people look (choices A and B) and indicate what Lymie does when his father joins him in the restaurant (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
6,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In the passage, Lymie closes his book only after “a coat that he recognized as his father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair” (lines 67-68). It is Lymie’s father’s arrival that causes him to close the book. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because lines 67-70 of the passage clearly establish that Lymie closes his book because his father has arrived, not that he does so because the party of four is too loud (choice B), because he has finished reading a section of the book (choice C), or because he is getting ready to leave (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,
7,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 74-79, the narrator describes Mr. Peters as “gray” and balding, noting that he has “lost weight” and his color is “poor.” This description suggests Mr. Peters is aging and losing strength and vigor. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the description of Mr. Peters in lines 74-79 suggests he is a person who is wan and losing vitality, not someone who is healthy and in good shape (choice A), angry and intimidating (choice B), or emotionally anxious (choice C).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
8,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the last paragraph of the passage, Mr. Peters is described as being unaware “that there had been any change” in his appearance since he was younger (lines 80-81). Later in the paragraph, the passage states that “the young man” Mr. Peters once was “had never for one second deserted” him (lines 90-91). The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters still thinks of himself as young, or at least acts as if he is a younger version of himself. Choice A is incorrect because Mr. Peters is spending time with Lymie, his son, and there is no indication that he generally does not spend time with his family. Choice C is incorrect because although there are brief mentions of a diamond ring and manicured fingers, the paragraph focuses on Mr. Peters’s overall appearance, not on his awareness of status symbols. Choice D is incorrect because the last paragraph clearly states that Mr. Peters is “not aware that there had been any change” and thinks of himself as young",FALSE,reading,mcq,
9,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In lines 81-85, Mr. Peters is described as having “straightened his tie selfconsciously” and gestured with a menu “so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth finger of his right hand.” Mr. Peters’s actions are those of someone who wants to attract attention and be noticed. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the idea Mr. Peters wants to attract attention to himself. Choices A and C address Mr. Peters’s view of himself. Choice D indicates that Mr. Peters’s view of himself affects his behavior but does not reveal that he acts in a way meant to draw attention.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
10,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The last sentence of the passage states that Mr. Peters’s mischaracterization of himself makes him act in ways that are not “becoming” for a man of his age. In this context, “becoming” suggests behavior that is appropriate or fitting. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of describing one’s behavior, “becoming” means appropriate or fitting, not becoming known (choice A), becoming more advanced (choice C), or simply occurring (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
11,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beecher makes the point that even if women in her society are perceived as being inferior to men, they are still able to effect considerable influence on that society: “But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading” (lines 6-10). Choice A is incorrect because Beecher describes the dynamic between men and women in terms of the way they can change society, not in terms of security and physical safety. Choice C is incorrect because even though Beecher implies that women have fewer rights in society than men do, she doesn’t say that women have fewer responsibilities. Choice D is incorrect because Beecher does not assert that women are superior to men.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
12,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The previous question asks what point Beecher makes regarding the relationship between men and women in her society, with the answer being that women are considered inferior but can still have influence. This is supported in lines 6-10: “But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading.” Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about the point Beecher makes regarding the relationship between men and women in her society. Instead, they describe ways men can affect society (choices B and C) and explain how certain actions undertaken by a woman can be viewed negatively (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
13,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the third paragraph (lines 22-37), Beecher suggests that women can be “so much respected, esteemed and loved” by those around them that men will accede to their wishes: “then, the fathers, the husbands, and the sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly . . . .” These lines show that Beecher believes women can influence society by influencing the men around them; in other words, women have an indirect influence on public life. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because lines 34-37 make it clear that Beecher believes women do have an effect on society, even if it is an indirect effect. Beecher does not indicate that women’s effect on public life is ignored because most men are not interested (choice A), unnecessary because men do not need help governing society (choice C), or merely symbolic because women tend to be idealistic (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,
14,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Regarding the dynamic of men and women in society, Beecher says that one sex is given “the subordinate station” while the other is given the “superior” station (lines 1-2). In the context of how one gender exists in comparison to the other, the word “station” suggests a standing or rank. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in the context of the relative standing of men and women in Beecher’s society, the word “station” suggests a standing or rank, not a physical location or area (choices A, B, and C).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
15,C,"Choice C is the best answer. When describing how men and women can influence society, Beecher says the ways they can do so “should be altogether different and peculiar” (lines 11-12). In the context of the “altogether different” ways men and women can influence society, the word “peculiar” implies being unique or distinctive. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in the context of the “altogether different” ways men and women can influence society, the word “peculiar” suggests something unique or distinctive, not something unusual and odd (choice A), unexpected (choice B), or rare (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
16,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because they are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that “human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature” and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, “Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.” Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women inherently have the same rights (“rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,” lines 65-66). Her central claim is not that men and women need to work together to change society (choice B), that moral rights are the distinguishing characteristic separating humans from animals (choice C), or that there should be equal opportunities for men and women to advance and succeed.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
17,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the point that human rights are not fleeting or changeable but things that remain, regardless of the circumstances, because they are tied to humans’ moral nature. She emphasizes that human rights exist even if societal laws attempt to contradict or override them, citing slavery as an example: “These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: it is stamped on his moral being, and is, like it, imperishable” (lines 61-65). Choices A and D are incorrect because in Passage 2, Grimké makes the point that human rights are inherent and unchanging, not that they are viewed differently in different societies (choice A) or that they have changed and developed over time (choice D). Choice C is incorrect because Grimké doesn’t describe a clash between human rights and moral responsibilities; instead, she says that humans have rights “because they are moral beings” (lines 58-59).",FALSE,reading,mcq,
18,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks what point Grimké makes about human rights in Passage 2, with the answer being that they exist and have moral authority whether or not they are established by societal law. This is supported in lines 61-65: “These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: it is stamped on his moral being, and is, like it, imperishable.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about the point Grimké makes about human rights in Passage 2. Instead, they explain the source of all people’s human rights (choice A), indicate what would happen if rights were determined by gender (choice C), and discuss why gender is irrelevant to rights (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
19,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beecher asserts that men and women naturally have different positions in society: “Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station” (lines 1-2). She goes on to argue that a woman should act within her subordinate role to influence men but should not “exert coercive influences” that would put her “out of her appropriate sphere” (lines 44-46). In Passage 2, Grimké takes issue with the idea that men and women have different rights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states that “the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman” (lines 66-68). Choice A is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is proposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1. Choice C is incorrect because Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the view expressed in Passage 1; the passages were published at around the same time and both discuss contemporary society. Choice D is incorrect because Passage 2 does not elaborate on implications found in Passage 1 as much as it disputes the ideas explicitly expressed in Passage 1.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
20,A,"Choice A is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman’s role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1, Beecher writes that “while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading” (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people “are moral beings” (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have “rights and responsibilities” (line 68). She concludes that “whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do” (lines 81-83). Choice B is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice C is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women’s ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations. Choice D is incorrect because in Passage 1 Beecher argues that women should avoid direct political activism, cautioning against actions that would put them outside their “appropriate sphere” (line 46).",FALSE,reading,mcq,
21,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 65-68 of Passage 2, Grimké writes, “Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.” In other words, gender does not make men’s rights and duties superior to women’s. Beecher, on the other hand, begins Passage 1 by stating that “heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station,” suggesting that men and women have fundamentally different natures. Therefore, Beecher most likely would have disagreed with Grimké’s assertion. Choices A and B are incorrect because Beecher fundamentally disagrees with Grimké regarding the basic nature and societal roles of men and women, making it very unlikely that she would have viewed Grimké’s statement in lines 65-68 with either sympathy or agreement. Choice C is incorrect because Beecher wouldn’t necessarily have been dismayed by Grimké’s belief as much as she would have simply disagreed with it, and she does not indicate that the role of women in society is more difficult to play than is that of men.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
22,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In line 14, the passage states that industrial agriculture has become “incredibly efficient on a simple land to food basis.” In this context, “simple” suggests something basic or straightforward. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of a land to food dynamic, the word “simple” suggests something basic or straightforward, not something humble (choice B), something without any decoration or ornamentation (choice C), or something that requires little effort (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
23,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The passage clearly states that conventional agriculture is very efficient, especially when compared to organic farming: “organic farming yields 25% fewer crops on average than conventional agriculture” (lines 40-42) and in a study “organic farming delivered a lower yield for every crop type” (lines 51-52). It can therefore be understood from the passage that conventional agriculture does a good job maximizing the output of the land that is farmed. Choice A is incorrect because the passage states how efficient conventional agriculture is in regard to the amount of food it can produce but does not indicate that it produces a significantly wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Choice C is incorrect because even if the passage does say that each American farmer can produce crops to feed “over 155 people worldwide” (lines 16-17), it never claims that conventional agriculture can satisfactorily feed everyone in the world. Choice D is incorrect because the passage states that conventional agriculture uses a great deal of nitrogen, not that it changes the need for nitrogen in plant growth one way or the other.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
24,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The passage makes it clear that “most environmentalists” (line 27) believe conventional agriculture produces food that is not as healthy as food produced through organic farming and that it is more harmful to the environment than organic farming is: many environmentalists “have embraced organic food as better for the planet—and healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced by agricultural corporations” (lines 28-31). Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not supported by the passage. The passage never states that many environmentalists believe that conventional farming reduces the need to convert wilderness to farmland (choice B), is in any way good for the environment (choice C), or protects wildlife habitats (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,
25,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks how environmentalists perceive conventional agriculture, with the answer being that they believe it produces a product that is less healthy and more environmentally destructive than that produced by organic farming. This is supported in lines 28-31: “They have embraced organic food as better for the planet—and healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced by agricultural corporations.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about how environmentalists perceive the efforts of conventional agriculture. Although the lines in choice A do touch on environmentalists’ views, they indicate only that most environmentalists don’t view conventional agriculture’s ability to “produce more food on less land” (line 25) as beneficial to the environment. Choice C is incorrect because these lines address environmentalists’ view of the environmental effects of conventional and organic farming but not the taste or nutritional value of the food produced. Choice D is incorrect because these lines focus on a drawback to organic farming.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
26,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The passage makes it clear that while both conventional and organic farming need nitrogen for plant growth, conventional farming uses synthetic fertilizers and organic does not: “Conventional agriculture makes use of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the compost or cover crops used in organic farming” (lines 61-65). Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not state that conventional and organic farming are equally sustainable and does state that organic farming needs “more land” to produce “fewer crops” (lines 42-43) but does not indicate that it always requires dramatically more land. Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not state that organic farming uses artificial chemicals. Choice D is incorrect because the passage mentions nitrogen runoff only as a product of conventional farming, not organic farming, and does not indicate that only the nitrogen in conventional fertilizers is dangerous.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
27,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The previous question asks about the relationship between conventional agriculture and organic farming, with the answer being that unlike organic farms, conventional farms use synthetic fertilizers. This is supported in lines 61-65: “Conventional agriculture makes use of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the compost or cover crops used in organic farming.” Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about the relationship between conventional and organic farming, instead describing the efficiency only of conventional agriculture (choice A), discussing one perceived positive aspect of conventional agriculture (choice B), and highlighting a drawback of organic farming (choice C).",FALSE,reading,mcq,
28,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The passage states that the authors of the study comparing conventional and organic farming have come to the conclusion that an “ideal global agriculture system” would “borrow the best from both systems” (lines 80-82). The quote from Jonathan Foley in lines 84-97 indicates that this ideal system would take into consideration many different factors, including the nutrition and calories offered by specific types of foods as well as different geographic, economic, and social needs. Choices A and D are incorrect because the passage makes it clear that the “ideal global agriculture system” would give consideration to multiple factors, not that it would focus mainly on productivity (choice A) or nutritional value (choice D). Choice C is incorrect because Foley states that the ideal system would take economics into consideration but does not indicate that farmers’ economic interests would be weighed against consumers’ needs.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
29,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The passage states that conventional agriculture can be superior to organic farming in terms of producing “sheer calories” (line 88). In this context, “sheer” most nearly means pure; the passage is referring to the pure number of calories delivered by foods. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in the context of discussing the calories foods can provide, “sheer” suggests the pure number of calories. Also, it does not make sense to say that calories can be seen through (choice A), are somehow sudden or happen unexpectedly (choice B), or are at a very sharp angle (choice C).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
30,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Figure 1 shows that the organic yield as a percentage of conventional yield is similar for cereals and all crops, with both yielding roughly 75%. Choice A is incorrect because figure 1 shows that the organic yield as a percentage of conventional yield is higher for fruits (just under 100%) than for vegetables (just under 70%). Choice C is incorrect because figure 1 shows there were only 28 observations for oilseed crops. Choice D is incorrect because figure 1 shows that the organic yield as a percentage of conventional yield is higher for oilseed crops (approximately 90%) than for vegetables (just under 70%).",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
31,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Every organically grown species represented in figure 2 produces a smaller yield than do their conventional counterparts. All of the organically grown species are within a range of approximately 60–90% of the conventional yield. Choice A is incorrect because figure 2 shows that soybeans have the highest yield (approximately 90%), not the lowest. Choice B is incorrect because figure 2 shows that organically grown barley and maize are produced at a lower yield than the conventionally grown species (just below 70% and just below 90%, respectively), not a comparable one. Choice C is incorrect because figure 2 shows that soybeans, not tomatoes, have the highest yield of the organically grown species.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
32,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The majority of the passage focuses on the experiment concerning “how much the crowd influences the individual, and whether it can be controlled from outside” (lines 42-44). After explaining the experiment and the results it produced, the passage moves on to consider questions raised by the results, such as whether the findings are site specific or “true in general” (lines 75-76), why different findings are observed, and whether companies can “boost their products by manipulating online ratings on a massive scale” (lines 85-86). Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not conclude by explaining the practical ways the experiment’s findings have been applied but rather by considering questions the findings raise. Choices C and D are incorrect because the passage does not indicate that there were any flaws in the experiment’s findings and does not include statements from anyone who disputes the findings.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
33,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The author of the passage suggests that a group of people can be “wiser” and more effective than a single person at assessing a quantitative answer, or a measurement, versus producing a valid qualitative judgment, or a judgment of the quality of something. This is most clear in lines 11-14, which state that when guessing a bull’s weight or how many gumballs are in a jar, “your guess is probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the average of many people’s choices is remarkably close to the true number.” Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because lines 11-14 indicate that the author believes that crowds may be more effective than individuals when arriving at quantitative answers rather than qualitative results. Nothing in the passage suggests that the author believes that crowds are better at starting disagreements than studying an issue in depth (choice A), supporting ideas rather than challenging them (choice B), or ranking opinions rather than coming up with new ideas (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,
34,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks what the author of the passage suggests about the wisdom of crowds, with the answer being that crowds can be more effective at producing quantitative answers than qualitative results. This is supported in lines 11-14: when it comes to guessing a bull’s weight or how many gumballs are in a jar, “your guess is probably going to be far from the mark, whereas the average of many people’s choices is remarkably close to the true number.” Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous question about the author’s belief about when the wisdom of a crowd is effective. Instead, they simply state that crowds are sometimes wiser than individuals, without explaining when (choice A), put forth a theory held by someone other than the author (choice C), and explain how hypotheses about the wisdom of crowds could be tested (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND_OF_EVIDENCE
35,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In the passage, the author explains that those who are skeptical of the theory that “measuring the aggregate of people’s opinions produces a stable, reliable value” (lines 18- 20) believe that “people’s opinions are easily swayed by those of others” (lines 20-21). This idea is best supported in lines 55-58, which describe a finding from a study of opinions in crowds: “Comments that received fake positive votes from the researchers were 32% more likely to receive more positive votes compared with a control, the team reports.” In other words, people were more likely to give a positive vote when they thought other people had given positive votes.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
36,B,"Choice B is the best answer. One question Watts asks in regard to the experiment is whether the results would hold true on a larger scale. The passage quotes him in lines 74-76: “‘[But] one question is whether the positive [herding] bias is specific to this site’ or true in general.” Doing the experiment again but collecting ratings on multiple websites would address Watts’s question, as it would show whether or not the same results occur on other sites. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect. Providing fewer fake positive comments during the experiment (choice A), requiring users to be registered on the website (choice C), or telling users that their answers will be studied (choice D) are actions that likely would affect the results of the experiment involving users voting on comments about stories on one news website, but they would not address Watts’s questions about whether the study would produce the same results on other websites or why different categories of news items had different effects on the news website.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
37,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 85-86 the author asks, “Will companies be able to boost their products by manipulating online ratings on a massive scale?” In the context of selling products by manipulating user reviews, “boost” most nearly means promote. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in the context of selling products by manipulating user reviews, the word “boost” refers to promoting the products, not making them larger or bigger (choice A), faster (choice B), or safe (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
38,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 85-86 the author asks, “Will companies be able to boost their products by manipulating online ratings on a massive scale?” In the context of selling products by manipulating user reviews on a massive scale, the word “scale” most nearly means level or size. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of selling products by manipulating user reviews, a massive “scale” refers to a great level or size, not to a payment (choice B), an interval or space between things (choice C), or a plan (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
39,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The figure shows that while the mean score of the control comments in the politics category is below 2.0, the artificially up-voted mean score for that category is exactly 2.5. Choice A is incorrect because the artificially up-voted mean score of comments in the business category is higher than 3.0. Choice C is incorrect because the artificially up-voted mean score of comments in the fun category is less than 2.5.

40,D,Choice D is the best answer. The figure shows that the mean score for both control comments and artificially up-voted comments in the general news category is just above 2.0. Choice A is incorrect because the mean score for the control comments in the culture and society category is a little below 2.5 while the mean score for the artificially up-voted comments is over 3.0. Choice B is incorrect because the mean score for the control comments in the information technology category is a little above 1.5 while the mean score for the artificially up-voted comments is above 2.0.

42,C,"Choice C is the best answer. According to the passage, Maguire found that taxi drivers’ hippocampi are “7 percent larger than normal,” which is evidence that “way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains” (lines 10-14). In lines 20-26, the passage indicates that this finding challenges an earlier consensus: “It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons—that . . . the brain’s basic anatomical structure was more or less static. Maguire’s study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.” Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that Maguire used a new method in her study or that her findings demonstrate the validity of a method.

45,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The purpose of Maguire’s study of the mental athletes was to try to determine what it is that makes them so good at memorization, and in particular if they have structurally different brains than people without such extraordinary memorization skills or if they have normal brain structures but use them in unusual ways. This is supported in lines 33-37, which state that Maguire and her team “wanted to find out if the memorizers’ brains were—like the London cabbies’— structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.” Choice A is incorrect because the study was an attempt to compare the brains of mental athletes to the brains of the general population, not to compare the use of different brain structures in memorization and navigation.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of a study with two groups of subjects, the word “matched” suggests subjects that are similar or comparable, not ones that are exactly the same (choice B), ones that are recognizably different (choice C), or ones that are rivals (choice D).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS_IN_CONTEXT
48,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The main purpose of the fifth paragraph (lines 57-65) is to relate what Maguire discovered about the mental athletes, namely that their brain structures are not different from those of the control group but that the mental athletes use their brains differently: “there was one telling difference . . . regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be working in overdrive for the mental athletes.” Choice A is incorrect because the fifth paragraph does not mention the taxi drivers or the study involving them.

49,C,"Choice C is the best answer. The passage indicates that Maguire’s second study revealed that people in the control group don’t have different brain structures than the mental athletes but that they use their brains differently. In particular, the two groups use different pathways in the brain: “regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be working in overdrive for the mental athletes” (lines 63-65). Choices A and D are incorrect because the passage states that there was only “one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects” (lines 57-58); there is no indication that the control group showed less total brain activity or had smaller hippocampal regions.

50,A,"Choice A is the best answer. After establishing in lines 50-51 that the brains of the control group and the mental athletes seemed to be “indistinguishable,” the passage suggests that the reason mental athletes are so good at memorization is that they use parts of their brains that most other people don’t use when memorizing: “Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding” (lines 66-72). Choices B and C are incorrect because the passage explains that the mental athletes were converting information into images, not abstract symbols or numerical lists.

52,B,"Choice B is the best answer. According to the passage, Maguire’s study revealed that the mental athletes were using the same parts of the brain for memorization as were the London cabbies from the first study, a result that was initially puzzling. The questions in lines 74-78 highlight and expand on that result, making it clear that it is surprising to find that the mental athletes use images to remember numbers or use a part of the brain associated with navigation when trying to remember shapes. Although it became clear how the mental athletes were memorizing things, it was not clear why they were doing it that way. Choice A is incorrect because the questions in lines 74-78 seem to reflect additional questions Maguire and others had based on their result and do not suggest that Maguire’s conclusions may not be reliable. Choice C is incorrect because the passage makes no mention of any earlier studies of the phenomenon of using images to remember numbers or to use a part of the brain associated with navigation when trying to remember shapes.

43,A,"Choice A is the best answer because the transitional phrase “for example” appropriately indicates that the Help Me Investigate project discussed in the sentence is an example of the use of social media mentioned in the previous sentence. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because neither “therefore,” “however,” nor “in any case” indicates the true relationship between this and the previous sentence. The Help Me Investigate project discussed in the current sentence is an example of the use of social media mentioned in the previous sentence.",FALSE,writing,mcq,EXPRESSION_OF_IDEAS
44,C,"Choice C is the best answer because the full subject of the independent clause, “the advent of the digital age,” directly follows the dependent clause that introduces it. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the subjects of their independent clauses do not directly follow the introductory dependent clause. “Far from marking the end of investigative journalism” refers to the “advent of the digital age,” not to “cooperation among journalists” (choice A) or “the number of potential investigators” (choice B). In choice D, an interrupting phrase (“by facilitating cooperation among journalists and ordinary citizens”) separates the subject from the dependent clause that modifies it.",FALSE,writing,mcq,STANDARD_ENGLISH_CONVENTIONS
