1,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In the passage, a young man (Akira) asks
a mother (Chie) for permission to marry her daughter (Naomi). The
request was certainly surprising to the mother, as can be seen from
line 47, which states that prior to Akira’s question Chie “had no idea”
the request was coming.


Choice A is incorrect because the passage depicts two characters
engaged in a civil conversation, with Chie being impressed With
Akira’s “sincerity” and finding herself “starting to like him.” Choice C
is incorrect because the passage is focused on the idea of Akira’s


and Naomi’s present lives and possible futures. Choice D is incorrect
because the interactions between Chie and Akira are polite, not critical;
for example, Chie views Akira with “amusement,” not animosity.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
2,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The passage centers on a night when


a young man tries to get approval to marry a woman’s daughter. The
passage includes detailed descriptions of setting (a “winter’s eve” and
a “cold rain,” lines 5-6); character (Akira’s “soft, refined” voice, line 33;
Akira’s eyes “shliningl with sincerity,” line 35); and plot (“Naomi was
silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie’s eyes.
Finally, she spoke,” lines 88—89).


Choice A is incorrect because the passage focuses on a nontraditional
marriage proposal. Choice C is incorrect because the passage
concludes without resolution to the question of whether Akira and
Naomi will receive permission to marry. Choice D is incorrect because
the passage repeatedly makes clear that for Chie, her encounter with
Akira is momentous and unsettling, as when Akira acknowledges in
line 73 that he has “startled” her.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
3,C,"Choice C is the best answer. Akira “came directly, breaking all
tradition,” (line 1) when he approached Chie and asked to marry her
daughter, and he “ask[ed] directly,” without “a go-between” (line 65) or
“mediation,” because doing otherwise would have taken too much time.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in these contexts, “directly”
does not mean in a frank, confident, or precise manner.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS IN CONTEXT
4,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Akira is very concerned Chie will find his
marriage proposal inappropriate because he did not follow traditional
protocol and use a “go-between” (line 65). This is clear in lines 63-64,
when Akira says to Chie “Please don’t judge my candidacy by the
unseemliness of this proposal.”

Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that
Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
Choice C is incorrect because while Akira recognizes that his
unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will
reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal. Choice D

is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira
worries Chie will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND OF EVIDENCE
5,C,"Choice C is the best answer. In lines 63-64, Akira says to Chie,
“Please don’t judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this
proposal.” This reveals Akira’s concern that Chie may say no to the
proposal simply because Akira did not follow traditional practices.
Choices A, B, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer


to the previous question. Choice A is incorrect because line 33 merely
describes Akira’s voice as “soft, refined.” Choice B is incorrecl because
lines 49-51 reflect Chie’s perspective, not Akira’s. Choice D is incorrect
because lines 71-72 indicate only that Akira was speaking in an eager
and forthright matter.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
6,D,"Choice D is the best answer because Akira clearly treats Chie with
respect, including “bow[ing]” (line 26) to her, calling her “Madame”
(line 31), and looking at her with “a deferential peek” (line 34). Akira
does not offer Chie utter deference, though, as he asks to marry Naomi
after he concedes that he is not following protocol and admits to being
a “disruption” (line 31).

Choice A is incorrect because while Akira conveys respect to Chie, there
is no evidence in the passage that he feels affection for her. Choice B is
incorrect because neither objectivity nor impartiality accurately describes
how Akira addresses Chie. Choice C is incorrect because Akira conveys
respect to Chie and takes the conversation seriously.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
7,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on
how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter’s hand in marriage.
In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have
been more likely to say yes to Akira’s proposal if Akira had followed
tradition: “Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had
he followed form — had he asked his mother to speak to his father

to approach a go-between — would Chie have been more receptive?”
Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie
reacted a certain way to Akira’s proposal.

Choice A is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one
aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture

as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies

a criticism of Akira’s individual marriage proposal but not the entire
tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice C is incorrect
because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
8,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In line 1, the narrator suggests that
Akira’s direct approach broke “all tradition.” The narrator then
wonders if Akira had “followed form,” or the tradition expected of him,
would Chie have been more receptive to his proposal. In this context,
following “form” thus means following a certain tradition or custom.
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because in this context “form” does
not mean the way something looks (appearance), the way it is built
(structure), or its essence (nature).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS IN CONTEXT
9,C,"Choice C is the best answer. Akira states that his unexpected meeting
with Chie occurred only because of a “matter of urgency,” which he
explains as “an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle’s
Japanese community” (lines 41-42). Akira decides to directly speak to
Chie because Chie’s response to his marriage proposal affects whether
Akira accepts the job offer.

Choice A is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that
Akira is worried his parents will not approve of Naomi. Choice B is
incorrect because Akira has “an understanding” with Naomi (line 63).
Choice D is incorrect; while Akira may know that Chie is unaware

of his feelings for Naomi, this is not what he is referring to when he
mentions “a matter of urgency. ”",FALSE,reading,mcq,
10,B,"Choice B is the best answer. In lines 39-42, Akira clarifies that the “matter of urgency” is that he has “an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.” Akira needs Chie’s answer to his marriage proposal so he can decide whether to accept the job in Seattle.

Choices A, C, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer to
the previous question. Choice A is incorrect because in line 39 Akira
apologizes for interrupting Chie’s quiet evening. Choice C is incorrect
because lines 58-59 address the seriousness of Akira’s request, not its
urgency. Choice D is incorrect because line 73 shows only that Akira’s
proposal has “startled” Chie and does not explain why his request is
time—sensitive.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND OF EVIDENCE
11,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Lines 1-9 include examples of how many
people shop (“millions of shoppers”), how much money they spend
(“over $30 billion at retail stores in the month of December alone”),
and the many occasions that lead to shopping for gifts (“including
weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby showers”).
Combined, these examples show how frequently people in the US shop
for gifts.

Choice B is incorrect because even though the authors mention that
“$30 billion” had been spent in retail stores in one month, that figure
is never discussed as an increase (or a decrease). Choice C is incorrect
because lines 1—9 provide a context for the amount of shopping that
occurs in the US, but the anxiety (or “dread”) it might cause is not
introduced until later in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because
lines 1-9 do more than highlight the number of different occasions that
lead to gift-giving.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
12,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Lines 9-10 state “This frequent experience
of gift-giving can engender ambivalent feelings in gift-givers.” In

the subsequent sentences, those “ambivalent” feelings are further
exemplified as conflicted feelings, as shopping is said to be something
that “[mIany relish” (lines 10-11) and “many dread” (line 14).

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because in this context, “ambivalent”
does not mean feelings that are unrealistic, apprehensive, or supportive.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS IN CONTEXT
13,D,"Choice D is the best answer. In lines 10-13, the authors clearly state that
some people believe gift-giving can help a relationship because it “offers
a powerful means to build stronger bonds with one’s closest peers.”
Choice A is incorrect because even though the authors state that some
shoppers make their choices based on “egocentrism,” (line 33) there

is no evidence in the passage that people view shopping as a form of
self-expression. Choice B is incorrect because the passage implies
that shopping is an expensive habit. Choice C is incorrect because the
passage states that most people have purchased and received gifts,
but it never implies that people are required to reciprocate the
gift-giving process.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
14,A,"Choice A is the best answer. In lines 10-13, the authors suggest that
people value gift-giving because it may strengthen their relationships
with others: “Many relish the opportunity to buy presents because
gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger bonds with one’s
closest peers.”

Choices B, C, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer
to the previous question. Choice B is incorrect because lines 22-23
discuss how people often buy gifts that the recipients would not
purchase. Choice C is incorrect because lines 31-32 explain how gift-
givers often fail to consider the recipients’ preferences. Choice D is
incorrect because lines 44-47 suggest that the cost of a gift may not
correlate to a recipient’s appreciation of it.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND OF EVIDENCE
15,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The “deadweight loss” mentioned in the
second paragraph is the significant monetary difference between what
a gift-giver would pay for something and what a gift-recipient would
pay for the same item. That difference would be predictable to social
psychologists, whose research “has found that people often struggle
to take account of others’ perspectives — their insights are subject

to egocentrism, social projection, and multiple attribution errors”
lines 31-34).

Choices B, C, and D are all incorrect because lines 31-34 make clear
that social psychologists would expect a disconnect between gift-
givers and gift-recipients, not that they would question it, be disturbed
by it, or find it surprising or unprecedented.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
16,C,"Choice C is the best answer. Lines 41-44 suggest that gift-givers
assume a correlation between the cost of a gift and how well-received
it will be: “. . . gift-givers equate how much they spend with how
much recipients will appreciate the gift (the more expensive the gift,
the stronger a gift-recipient’s feelings of appreciation)” However, the
authors suggest this assumption may be incorrect or “unfounded”
(line 47), as gift-recipients “may not construe smaller and larger gifts
as representing smaller and larger signals of thoughtfulness and
consideration” (lines 63-65).

Choices A, B, and D are all incorrect because the passage neither
states nor implies that the gift-givers’ assumption is insincere,
unreasonable, or substantiated.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
17,C,"Choice C is the best answer. Lines 63-65 suggest that the assumption made by gift-givers in lines 41-44 may be incorrect. The gift-givers assume that recipients will have a greater appreciation for costly gifts than for less costly gifts, but the authors suggest this relationship may
be incorrect, as gift-recipients “may not construe smaller and larger
gifts as representing smaller and larger signals of thoughtfulness and
consideration” (lines 63-65).
Choices A and D are incorrect because lines 53-55 and 75-78 address
the question of “why” gift-givers make specific assumptions rather
than addressing the validity of these assumptions. Choice B is
incorrect because lines 55-60 focus on the reasons people give gifts to
others.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND OF EVIDENCE
18,D,"Choice D is the best answer. Lines 53-55 state that “Perhaps givers
believe that bigger (i.e., more expensive) gifts convey stronger signals
of thoughtfulness and consideration.” In this context, saying that more
expensive gifts “convey” stronger signals means the gifts send, or
communicate, stronger signals to the recipients.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in this context, to “convey”
something does not mean to transport it (physically move something),
counteract it (act in opposition to something), or exchange it (trade one
thing for another).",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS IN CONTEXT
19,A,"Choice A is the best answer. The paragraph examines how gift—givers
believe expensive gifts are more thoughtful than less expensive gifts
and will be more valued by recipients. The work of Camerer and
others offers an explanation for the gift-givers’ reasoning: “gift-givers
attempt to signal their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future relationship”
lines 57-60).

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the theory articulated

by Camerer and others is used to explain an idea put forward by

the authors (“givers believe that bigger . . . gifts convey stronger
signals”), not to introduce an argument, question a motive, or support
a conclusion.",FALSE,reading,mcq,COMMAND OF EVIDENCE
20,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The graph clearly shows that gift-givers
believe that a “more valuable” gift will be more appreciated than

a “less valuable gift.” According to the graph, gift-givers believe

the monetary value of a gift will determine whether that gift is well
received or not.

Choice A is incorrect because the graph does not suggest that gift-
givers are aware of gift-recipients’ appreciation levels. Choices C and
D are incorrect because neither the gift-givers’ desire for the gifts they
purchase nor the gift-givers’ relationship with the gift-recipients is
addressed in the graph.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
21,A,"Choice A is the best answer. Lines 69—75 explain that while people

are often both gift-givers and gift-receivers, they struggle to apply
information they learned as a gift—giver to a time when they were a gift-
receiver: “Yet, despite the extensive experience that people have as both
givers and receivers, they often struggle to transfer information gained
from one role (e.g., as a giver) and apply it in another, complementary
role (e.g., as a receiver)” The authors suggest that the disconnect
between how much appreciation a gift-giver thinks a gift merits and how
much appreciation a gift-recipient displays for the gift may be caused by
both individuals’ inability to comprehend the other’s perspective.
Choices B and C are incorrect because neither the passage nor the
graph addresses the idea that society has become more materialistic or
that there is a growing opposition to gift-giving. Choice D is incorrect
because the passage emphasizes that gift-givers and gift-recipients

fail to understand each other’s perspective, but it offers no evidence
that the disconnect results only from a failure to understand the

other’s intentions.",FALSE,reading,mcq,
22,B,"Choice B is the best answer. Lines 2-4 of the passage describe DNA
as “a very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a regular
alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.” The backbone of DNA,

in other words, is the main structure of a chain made up of repeating
units of sugar and phosphate.

Choice A is incorrect because the passage describes DNA on the
molecular level only and never mentions the spinal column of
organisms. Choice C is incorrect because the passage describes the
backbone of the molecule as having “a regular alternation” of sugar
and phosphate, not one or the other. Choice D is incorrect because the
nitrogenous bases are not the main structural unit of DNA; rather, they
are attached only to the repeating units of sugar.",FALSE,reading,mcq,WORDS IN CONTEXT
23,D,"Choice D is the best answer. The authors explain that hydrogen bonds
join together pairs of nitrogenous bases, and that these bases have a
specific structure that leads to the pairing: “One member of a pair must
be a purine and the other a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the
two chains” (lines 27-29). Given the specific chemical properties of a
nitrogenous base, it would be inaccurate to call the process random.
Choice A is incorrect because lines 5-6 describe how nitrogenous
bases attach to sugar but not how those bases pair with one another.

Choices A and B are incorrect because lines 12-14 explicitly state that
it is the two chains of DNA that are of “biological interest,” not the
chemical formula of DNA, nor the common fiber axis those two chains

The authors support this claim with evidence compiled from an X-ray:
“the density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that
there are two [chains]” (lines 18-19).

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the authors mention

26,B,"Choice B is the best answer. The authors explain that “only certain pairs
of bases will fit into the structure” (lines 25-26) of the DNA molecule.
These pairs must contain “a purine and the other a pyrimidine in order

other pairing would not “fit into the structure” of the DNA molecule.
Therefore, a pair of purines would be larger than the required purine/
pyrimidine pair and would not fit into the structure of the DNA molecule.
Choice A is incorrect because this section is not discussing the
distance between a sugar and phosphate group. Choice C is incorrect
because the passage never makes clear the size of the pyrimidines or
purines in relation to each other, only in relation to the space needed to
bond the chains of the DNA molecule. Choice D is incorrect because the

one of the pair of chains were given, one could write down the exact order of the bases on the other one, because of the specific pairing.
Thus one chain is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is

base pairings along a DNA chain is understood and predictable, and 
may explain how DNA “duplicate[s] itself” (line 51). 

Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that most 
nucleotide sequences are known. Choice B is incorrect because these

Whether people in a group are friendly to one another; she is concerned
with generating solidarity among women. Choice B is incorrect
because though Woolf admits women have predominantly “done their
thinking” within traditional female roles (lines 64-69), she does not use

reflection; she is analyzing “the procession of the sons of educated men”

earthly demands for precious metals, such as platinum and gold, and
the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium

gathered as a result of space mining, and that these materials may be
important to Earth’s economy.

Choices B, C, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer to
the previous question. Choice B is incorrect because lines 24-28 focus

the other hand, recognizes the possible benefits of space mining but
also states that space mining should be thoughtfully considered before

concerns about a concept discussed in Passage 1.

Choice A is incorrect because the author of Passage 2 does not refute
the central claim of Passage 1; both authors agree there are possible
benefits to space mining. Choice B is incorrect because the author of
